# Domains Directory - Organized Context by Domain

**Purpose**: Organize La Factoria context by logical domains while preserving ALL project-specific content.

## üìÅ Domain Organization Structure

### üéì Educational (`educational/`)
All context related to educational content, frameworks, and quality assessment:
- Educational content types (8 types) and examples
- Quality assessment frameworks and metrics
- Pedagogical patterns and best practices
- Educational standards and compliance
- Learning science and cognitive frameworks

### üîß Technical (`technical/`)
All technology stack and infrastructure context:
- FastAPI backend patterns and configurations
- React frontend components and patterns
- Database design and integration patterns
- Testing frameworks and quality assurance
- Development workflow and tooling

### ü§ñ AI Integration (`ai-integration/`)
All AI service integration and content generation context:
- Vertex AI, OpenAI, Anthropic integration patterns
- Prompt engineering templates and optimization
- Content generation orchestration
- AI model selection and performance optimization
- Multi-provider failover and scaling

### üöÄ Operations (`operations/`)
All deployment, monitoring, and operational context:
- Railway deployment patterns and configuration
- Monitoring, alerting, and analytics
- Security frameworks and compliance
- Performance optimization and scaling
- Incident response and troubleshooting

## üîó Cross-Domain Integration

### Context Linking Strategy
- **Clear Cross-References**: Each domain references related context in other domains
- **Shared Components**: Common patterns accessible from multiple domains
- **Navigation Indexes**: Easy discovery of related context across domains
- **Living Documentation**: Context linked to actual working examples

### Domain Interaction Patterns
- **Educational ‚Üî AI Integration**: Quality assessment frameworks inform AI generation
- **Technical ‚Üî Operations**: Infrastructure patterns support deployment requirements
- **AI Integration ‚Üî Technical**: AI services integrate with backend API architecture
- **Educational ‚Üî Technical**: Educational requirements drive technical implementation

## üéØ Organization Principles

### Content Preservation Commitment
- **ZERO DELETION**: All existing project-specific context is preserved
- **Domain-Specific Grouping**: Related context logically organized together
- **Improved Discoverability**: Easier to find relevant context for specific tasks
- **Maintained Relationships**: Cross-domain connections clearly documented

### Quality Standards
- **Consistency**: Uniform organization patterns across all domains
- **Completeness**: All aspects of La Factoria system covered
- **Clarity**: Easy navigation and context discovery
- **Maintenance**: Clear guidelines for adding and updating domain content
