# Tool Optimization Plan - Principle of Least Privilege

## Agent Categories and Minimal Tool Requirements:

### 1. Research/Analysis Agents (Read-only + specific needs)
- content-researcher: WebSearch, WebFetch, Read, Task (remove Grep, Glob - not needed for research)
- context-explorer: Read, LS, Bash, TodoWrite (remove Grep, Glob - basic analysis)
- project-assessor: Read, Bash, Grep, Glob, TodoWrite (assessment needs file analysis)

### 2. Planning Agents (Read + Write + Analysis)
- dev-planner: Read, Write, TodoWrite, WebSearch (remove Edit, Grep, Glob - planning focused)
- context-planner: Read, Write, LS, TodoWrite (remove Edit, Grep, Glob - planning focused)

### 3. Implementation Agents (Full file manipulation)
- dev-implementer: Read, Write, Edit, MultiEdit, Bash, TodoWrite (core implementation tools)
- context-implementer: Read, Write, Edit, MultiEdit, LS, TodoWrite (context file manipulation)
- code-cleaner: Read, Write, Edit, MultiEdit, Bash, Grep, Glob (code manipulation + analysis)

### 4. Validation Agents (Analysis + Testing)
- dev-validator: Bash, Grep, Glob, TodoWrite (validation testing)
- cleanup-validator: Bash, Read, Grep, Glob, TodoWrite (analysis focused)
- context-validator: Bash, Read, LS, TodoWrite (context analysis)

### 5. Content Generation Agents (Read + Write + Minimal)
- study-guide: Read, Write, Task (remove unnecessary tools)
- podcast-script: Read, Write, Task (remove unnecessary tools)
- master-outline: Read, Write, Task (remove unnecessary tools)

### 6. Orchestrator Agents (Coordination + Management)
- dev-orchestrator: Read, Write, TodoWrite, Task (coordination focused)
- content-orchestrator: Read, Write, TodoWrite, Task, WebSearch (content coordination)
- cleanup-orchestrator: Read, Write, TodoWrite, Task, Bash (cleanup coordination)
- context-orchestrator: Read, Write, TodoWrite, Task, LS (context coordination)

### 7. Specialized Technical Agents (Domain-specific tools)
- fastapi-dev: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, TodoWrite (backend development)
- frontend-dev: Read, Write, Edit, TodoWrite (frontend development)
- db-dev: Read, Write, Edit, Bash (database work)
- security-dev: Read, Bash, Grep, Glob, WebSearch (security analysis)
- perf-dev: Read, Bash, Grep, Glob (performance analysis)
- dev-deployer: Bash, Read, Write, TodoWrite (deployment focused)
