```

#### Phase 3: Coordinated Multi-Content Generation
```bash
# Parallel content generation across specialized agents
sequence: @agent-master-outline → foundation complete
↓ (master outline distributed to all content agents)
parallel: @agent-study-guide + @agent-podcast-script + @agent-quality-assessor

# Study guide generation
@agent-study-guide "/meta-prompt-context Generate comprehensive study guide using master outline foundation

/meta-prompt-standards Study guide requirements:
- Master outline alignment and learning objective integration
- Age-appropriate explanations and examples
- Interactive elements and practice exercises
- Self-assessment opportunities and review sections
- Educational effectiveness targeting ≥0.85 quality score

Using master outline: [OUTLINE_CONTENT]
Generate comprehensive study guide for topic: [TOPIC]"

# Podcast script generation
@agent-podcast-script "/meta-prompt-context Create engaging podcast script using master outline structure

/meta-prompt-standards Podcast script requirements:
- Conversational tone appropriate for audio delivery
- Master outline topic progression and learning objectives
- Speaker notes and audio production guidance
- Engagement techniques for audio learning
- Educational effectiveness targeting ≥0.85 quality score

Using master outline: [OUTLINE_CONTENT]
Create comprehensive podcast script for topic: [TOPIC]"

# Quality assessment coordination
@agent-quality-assessor "/meta-prompt-context Assess educational content quality across all generated content types

/meta-prompt-standards Quality assessment requirements:
- Educational effectiveness evaluation (target ≥0.85)
- Age-appropriateness validation (target ≥0.80)
- Learning objective alignment assessment
- Pedagogical quality and coherence evaluation
- Content consistency across all 8 content types

Assess content quality for all generated materials and provide improvement recommendations."
```

#### Phase 4: Comprehensive Quality Validation
```bash
# Educational standards validation across all content
@agent-educational-validator "/meta-prompt-context Validate educational standards compliance across all 8 content types

/meta-prompt-standards Educational validation requirements:
- Age-appropriateness standards compliance verification
- Learning effectiveness and pedagogical quality assessment
- Educational accessibility and inclusivity validation
- Content accuracy and factual verification
- Overall educational value and effectiveness confirmation

/meta-prompt-validate educational-standards 'Comprehensive educational compliance validation'

Validation scope:
1. Master Content Outline - Foundation structure and learning objectives
2. Study Guide - Comprehensive educational material quality
3. Flashcards - Memorization effectiveness and accuracy
4. Podcast Script - Audio learning effectiveness and engagement
5. One-Pager Summary - Concise information clarity and completeness
6. Detailed Reading Material - In-depth content quality and examples
7. FAQ Collection - Question completeness and answer accuracy

@agent-content-orchestrator "Adapt content generation approach based on:
- Target audience: [AGE_GROUP] - [EDUCATION_LEVEL]
- Topic complexity: [COMPLEXITY_LEVEL]
- Learning objectives: [OBJECTIVES]
- Time constraints: [DURATION]
- Special requirements: [REQUIREMENTS]

Coordinate specialized agents for optimal content adaptation and quality."
```

#### Quality Improvement Loops
```bash
# Iterative quality improvement coordination
@agent-quality-assessor → quality assessment results
↓ (assessment informs improvement)
@agent-content-orchestrator → coordinate improvements across agents
↓ (improved content validated)
@agent-educational-validator → final educational standards validation
```

#### Cross-Content Integration
```bash
# Ensure coherence and integration across all 8 content types
integration_validation() {
    # Verify master outline serves as foundation for all content
    # Ensure consistent learning objectives across content types
    # Validate complementary information without redundancy
    # Confirm age-appropriate consistency across all materials
    # Assess overall educational coherence and effectiveness
}
```
