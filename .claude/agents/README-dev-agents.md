# La Factoria Development Agents Usage Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ Complete Development Agent System

This guide covers the **development agents** for building La Factoria (different from the production content generation agents that will be deployed to LangChain).

### Agent Architecture Overview

**Important**: Agents are organized using `agent-[xxxx]-[xxxx]` naming convention for file organization, but invoked using shorter names in Claude Code (e.g., `@dev-orchestrator` not `@agent-dev-orchestrator`).

#### Core Workflow Agents (High Priority)
- `@dev-orchestrator` (file: agent-dev-orchestrator.md) - Master coordinator with meta prompt enhancement
- `@dev-explorer` (file: agent-dev-explorer.md) - Codebase discovery and analysis
- `@dev-planner` (file: agent-dev-planner.md) - Architecture planning and TDD task breakdown
- `@dev-implementer` (file: agent-dev-implementer.md) - Test-driven development specialist
- `@dev-validator` (file: agent-dev-validator.md) - Quality gates and compliance enforcement
- `@dev-deployer` (file: agent-dev-deployer.md) - Railway deployment orchestration

#### Specialized Technical Agents (Medium Priority)
- `@fastapi-dev` (file: agent-fastapi-dev.md) - Backend API development specialist
- `@frontend-dev` (file: agent-frontend-dev.md) - Vanilla JS frontend builder
- `@db-dev` (file: agent-db-dev.md) - Railway Postgres database designer
- `@security-dev` (file: agent-security-dev.md) - Security auditing and GDPR compliance
- `@perf-dev` (file: agent-perf-dev.md) - Performance monitoring and optimization

## ðŸš€ Quick Start: Complete Development Workflow

### 1. **Project Discovery and Planning**
```bash
# Start with project exploration
@dev-orchestrator "Analyze the current La Factoria codebase and create a comprehensive implementation plan for the simplification architecture following .claude/memory/simplification_plan.md"

# This will automatically use meta prompt enhancement to:
# 1. Coordinate @dev-explorer for codebase analysis
# 2. Coordinate @dev-planner for TDD task breakdown
# 3. Apply simplification constraints (â‰¤200 lines per file, â‰¤20 dependencies)
# 4. Create quality gate checkpoints
```

### 2. **TDD Implementation Phase**
```bash
# Implement backend with TDD methodology
@dev-orchestrator "Implement the FastAPI backend for La Factoria following TDD red-green-refactor cycles. Ensure all code meets simplification constraints and quality standards."

# This coordinates:
# - @fastapi-dev for API implementation
# - @db-dev for database design
# - @dev-implementer for TDD methodology
# - @dev-validator for quality gates
```

### 3. **Frontend Development**
```bash
# Build vanilla JS frontend
@dev-orchestrator "Create the frontend interface for La Factoria using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Integrate with the FastAPI backend and ensure responsive design."

# This coordinates:
# - @frontend-dev for UI implementation
# - @perf-dev for performance optimization
# - @security-dev for frontend security
```

### 4. **Security and Performance Validation**
```bash
# Comprehensive security and performance audit
@dev-orchestrator "Conduct complete security audit and performance optimization for La Factoria. Ensure GDPR compliance and Railway deployment readiness."

# This coordinates:
# - @security-dev for security audit
# - @perf-dev for performance validation
# - @dev-validator for compliance checks
```

### 5. **Production Deployment**
```bash
# Deploy to Railway platform
@dev-orchestrator "Deploy La Factoria to Railway platform with full production configuration including monitoring, health checks, and environment management."

# This coordinates:
# - @dev-deployer for Railway deployment
# - @perf-dev for production monitoring
# - @security-dev for production security
```

## ðŸ§  Meta Prompt Enhancement System

The `@dev-orchestrator` automatically enhances all sub-agent instructions using meta prompts:

### Meta Prompt Pattern Examples

#### Enhanced Task Delegation
```bash
# Before: Basic instruction
@fastapi-dev "Build the backend API"

# After: Meta-enhanced instruction
@fastapi-dev "/meta-prompt-context La Factoria educational content platform with 8 content types targeting Railway deployment with strict simplification: â‰¤200 lines per file, â‰¤20 total dependencies.

/meta-prompt-standards Implement FastAPI backend with:
- TDD methodology (write tests first)
- 80% minimum test coverage
- Production-ready error handling
- Railway-optimized configuration
- Anthropic Claude integration for content generation

/meta-prompt-simplify Follow single-file architecture where possible:
- main.py (â‰¤200 lines) - FastAPI app and endpoints
- models.py (â‰¤50 lines) - Pydantic models
- content_service.py (â‰¤100 lines) - AI integration

Build the core FastAPI backend for La Factoria educational content generation."
```

### Available Meta Prompt Commands

#### Context Enhancement
- `/meta-prompt-context` - Add La Factoria project context and constraints
- `/meta-prompt-educational` - Add educational content requirements
- `/meta-prompt-railway` - Add Railway platform optimization context

#### Standards Injection
- `/meta-prompt-standards` - Inject quality and compliance requirements
- `/meta-prompt-tdd` - Add test-driven development methodology
- `/meta-prompt-security` - Add security and GDPR requirements

#### Simplification Enforcement
- `/meta-prompt-simplify` - Apply simplification constraints
- `/meta-prompt-constraints` - Enforce file size and dependency limits
- `/meta-prompt-optimize` - Add performance optimization requirements

## ðŸ“‹ Specific Agent Usage Patterns

### Core Development Workflow

#### Discovery and Analysis
```bash
# Comprehensive codebase analysis
@dev-explorer "Analyze the current La Factoria project structure, identify implementation gaps, and assess compliance with the simplification plan in .claude/memory/simplification_plan.md. Focus on file sizes, dependency count, and architecture alignment."

# Create implementation roadmap
@dev-planner "Using the explorer analysis, create a detailed TDD implementation plan for La Factoria simplification. Break down all features into test-first development tasks with clear acceptance criteria and quality gates."
```

#### TDD Implementation
```bash
# Backend development with TDD
@dev-implementer "Implement the FastAPI health check endpoint using TDD methodology. Write failing tests first, implement minimal code to pass tests, then refactor for quality. Ensure file size â‰¤200 lines and follow Railway optimization patterns."

# Quality validation
@dev-validator "Validate the health check implementation against quality gates: test coverage â‰¥80%, file size â‰¤200 lines, no security vulnerabilities, Railway deployment readiness."
```

#### Specialized Development
```bash
# Database schema design
@db-dev "Design the minimal PostgreSQL schema for La Factoria educational content storage. Focus on 5 core tables maximum, Railway Postgres optimization, and GDPR compliance with CASCADE deletion."

# Security implementation
@security-dev "Implement API key authentication with rate limiting for La Factoria. Include input validation, XSS prevention, SQL injection protection, and GDPR user data export/deletion capabilities."

# Performance optimization
@perf-dev "Implement performance monitoring for La Factoria with Railway-specific optimizations. Ensure â‰¤2s API response times, â‰¤1s frontend load times, and efficient resource usage within Railway constraints."
```

### Advanced Coordination Patterns

#### Multi-Agent Workflows
```bash
# Parallel development coordination
@dev-orchestrator "Coordinate parallel development of backend (@fastapi-dev + @db-dev) and frontend (@frontend-dev) while ensuring API contract compatibility and shared security standards (@security-dev)."

# Quality assurance pipeline
@dev-orchestrator "Establish continuous quality pipeline with @dev-validator running automated checks after each @dev-implementer cycle, feeding results back to @dev-planner for task refinement."
```

#### Integration Testing
```bash
# End-to-end integration
@dev-orchestrator "Conduct full integration testing across frontend, backend, database, and deployment layers. Validate complete user workflow from content request to generation and delivery."
```
