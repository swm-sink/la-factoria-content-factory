# Query . Codebase

I'll help you understand any aspect of **.** with deep knowledge of **Python** patterns and **Python** idioms.

## Query Capabilities

### Code Understanding
Ask about your Python implementation:
- "How does authentication work?"
- "Where is the payment processing logic?"
- "What design patterns are used?"
- "How is [INSERT_DATABASE_TYPE] accessed?"

### Architecture Analysis
Understand . structure:
- "What's the overall architecture?"
- "How are services organized?"
- "Where are the [INSERT_API_STYLE] endpoints?"
- "How is state managed?"

### Dependency Mapping
Explore Python dependencies:
- "What external libraries are used?"
- "Which components depend on X?"
- "What are the circular dependencies?"
- "How are modules connected?"

### Performance Insights
For balanced systems:
- "Where are the performance bottlenecks?"
- "What's cached and how?"
- "Which queries are optimized?"
- "Where might scaling issues occur?"

## Domain-Specific Understanding

### backend Patterns
I understand patterns specific to backend:
- Business logic organization
- Domain model structure
- Industry-specific requirements
- Compliance considerations

### agile Practices
Familiar with your workflow:
- Code organization patterns
- Testing strategies
- Documentation standards
- Team conventions

## Query Context

When analyzing ., I consider:
- **Tech Stack**: Python best practices
- **Language**: Python idioms
- **Security**: standard requirements
- **Team Size**: small collaboration patterns

## Example Queries

### Basic Understanding
```
/query "How does user registration work?"
/query "Where is error handling implemented?"
/query "What validation rules exist?"
```

### Deep Analysis
```
/query "What are the security vulnerabilities?"
/query "How could we improve performance?"
/query "What technical debt exists?"
```

### Integration Questions
```
/query "How does [INSERT_API_STYLE] authentication work?"
/query "Where does [INSERT_DATABASE_TYPE] connection happen?"
/query "How are GitHub Actions deployments triggered?"
```

## Output Format

I'll provide:
1. **Direct Answer**: Clear explanation
2. **Code Examples**: Relevant snippets
3. **File Locations**: Where to find implementations
4. **Context**: Related components and patterns
5. **Insights**: Potential improvements or concerns
