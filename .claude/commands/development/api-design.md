# API Design for .

I'll help you design **[INSERT_API_STYLE]** APIs following **[INSERT_backend_STANDARDS]** best practices.

## Project API Configuration
- **API Style**: [INSERT_API_STYLE]
- **Primary Language**: Python
- **Database**: [INSERT_DATABASE_TYPE]
- **Authentication**: Based on standard security
- **Domain Standards**: [INSERT_backend_STANDARDS]

## [INSERT_API_STYLE] Best Practices

### For backend Domain
Applying [INSERT_backend_STANDARDS] which includes:
- Industry-specific data models
- Compliance requirements
- Performance expectations
- Security protocols

### [INSERT_API_STYLE] Patterns
Based on your choice of [INSERT_API_STYLE]:
- Schema design principles
- Error handling standards
- Versioning strategy
- Documentation format

## Integration Points

### With Python
- Framework-specific patterns
- Library integrations
- Middleware configuration
- Performance optimizations

### With [INSERT_DATABASE_TYPE]
- Query optimization
- Data modeling
- Transaction handling
- Caching strategy

## Security Level: standard

Your standard security requirements mandate:
- Authentication methods
- Authorization patterns
- Data encryption
- Audit logging
- Rate limiting

## Testing with pytest

API tests will use pytest:
- Unit test patterns
- Integration test setup
- Contract testing
- Load testing approach

## Deployment to production

Considering production requirements:
- Scaling configuration
- Monitoring setup
- Health checks
- Service discovery
