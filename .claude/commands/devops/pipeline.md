# /pipeline - Unified Pipeline Orchestration for .
Comprehensive pipeline orchestration for . combining creation, execution, monitoring, deployment, GitHub Actions setup, and build automation optimized for Python and small teams.

## Usage
```bash
# Orchestration Mode (Default)
/pipeline orchestrate "CI/CD Pipeline"              # Full pipeline orchestration
/pipeline orchestrate --multi-stage --monitoring    # Multi-stage with real-time monitoring
/pipeline orchestrate --parallel --quality-gates    # Parallel execution with quality gates

# Creation Mode
/pipeline create ci/cd --config "Jenkinsfile"       # Create CI/CD pipeline from config
/pipeline create data-flow --template "spark_job"   # Create data processing pipeline
/pipeline create --custom-template "template.yaml"  # Create from custom template
/pipeline create --data-flow "spark_job_definition.py" # Create data flow pipeline for Spark job

# Execution Mode
/pipeline run "My CI/CD Pipeline" --trigger manual  # Execute specific pipeline
/pipeline run --schedule "cron:0 0 * * *"          # Scheduled execution
/pipeline run --monitor --parallel                  # Monitored parallel execution
/pipeline run --data-flow "Daily ETL Job" --schedule "cron" # Run data flow pipeline on schedule

# Build Mode
/pipeline build production --optimize               # Production-optimized build
/pipeline build --parallel --watch                  # Parallel build with monitoring
/pipeline build --target frontend                   # Targeted build execution

# Deployment Mode to production
/pipeline deploy production --blue-green            # Blue-green to production
/pipeline deploy --canary --rollback-ready          # Canary for users users
/pipeline deploy --zero-downtime --health-check     # Zero-downtime for balanced

# Rollback Mode
/pipeline rollback "v1.2.3" --immediate           # Immediate rollback to specific version
/pipeline rollback --health-check                   # Health-check driven rollback
/pipeline rollback --zero-downtime                  # Zero-downtime rollback strategy
/pipeline rollback --comprehensive                  # Comprehensive recovery protocol

# CI/CD Setup Mode for GitHub Actions
/pipeline setup GitHub Actions --repo "."  # Setup GitHub Actions
/pipeline setup GitHub Actions --template Python  # With language template
/pipeline setup GitHub Actions --custom-config config.xml  # Custom configuration

# Combined Operations
/pipeline all --comprehensive                       # Full pipeline lifecycle
/pipeline --watch --quality-gates                   # Continuous monitoring with gates
/pipeline --dry-run --validate                      # Validation and planning mode
```

## Pipeline Orchestration Modes
