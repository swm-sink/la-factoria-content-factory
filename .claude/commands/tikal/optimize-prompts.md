# Tikal Prompt Optimization

I'll analyze and optimize Tikal's content generation prompts to improve quality, consistency, and performance.

## Your Task
Optimize prompts for: $ARGUMENTS

## Context Awareness
I understand that Tikal is an AI-powered educational content generation platform with:
- 8 content types: master outline, podcast script, study guide, one-pager, detailed reading, FAQ, flashcards, reading guide
- FastAPI backend with Python services
- Quality validation pipeline with metrics
- Existing prompts in `app/core/prompts/v1/`

## Execution Steps

### 1. **Analyze Current Prompts**
I'll examine the existing prompts in `app/core/prompts/v1/` to identify:
- Inconsistencies in structure and requirements
- Redundant or verbose instructions
- Missing educational best practices
- Quality requirements that could be improved

### 2. **Educational Content Optimization**
I'll optimize prompts specifically for educational content by:
- Adding age-appropriate language guidelines
- Including learning objective alignment
- Enhancing content structure requirements
- Adding pedagogical framework integration

### 3. **Quality Enhancement**
I'll improve quality requirements by:
- Adding specific quality metrics and thresholds
- Including factual accuracy validation steps
- Enhancing readability and engagement requirements
- Adding bias prevention and inclusivity guidelines

### 4. **Performance Optimization**
I'll optimize for token efficiency by:
- Removing redundant instructions
- Consolidating similar requirements
- Using more efficient instruction patterns
- Maintaining critical information while reducing length

### 5. **Consistency Standardization**
I'll standardize across all content types:
- Consistent format and structure
- Unified quality requirements
- Standard variable naming
- Common validation criteria

## Expected Output
- Optimized prompt files with 20-40% token reduction
- Enhanced quality requirements and validation
- Consistent structure across all content types
- Educational best practices integration
- Performance metrics for optimization effectiveness

## Validation Steps
I'll verify the optimizations by:
- Comparing token counts before/after
- Checking all required variables are preserved
- Validating prompt clarity and specificity
- Ensuring educational standards are met
