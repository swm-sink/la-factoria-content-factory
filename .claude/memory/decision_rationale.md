# Decision Rationale & Context

## Decision: Complexity Assessment Methodology (2025-08-02)

### Context
Initial simplification analysis showed ~90% complexity reduction possible for "simple 1-10 user app"

### Key Evidence Discovered
1. **File**: `/app/services/user_data_deletion.py` (Line 2-8)
   - Purpose: GDPR compliance system with audit trails
   - Justification: Legal requirement, not over-engineering

2. **File**: `/docs/sla.md` (Lines 10-14)
   - Content: 99.9% uptime SLA, 43.2 minute monthly error budget
   - Justification: Contractual obligations likely exist

3. **File**: `/iac/modules/iam/audit_logging.tf` (Multiple resources)
   - Content: Comprehensive GCP service audit logging
   - Justification: Regulatory/compliance requirements

### Decision Rationale
**Complexity must be assessed against business requirements, not just user count**

Small user bases can still require enterprise-grade features due to:
- Legal compliance (GDPR, industry regulations)
- Contractual SLA obligations
- Audit/regulatory requirements
- Data sensitivity/security needs

### Implications
1. Simplification approach must be **selective**, not wholesale
2. Compliance-required components are **non-negotiable**
3. Focus on identifying **truly unnecessary** complexity
4. Risk assessment required before any removal

### Future Decision Framework
1. **Context Discovery**: Understand business/legal requirements first
2. **Component Classification**: Required vs. Optional complexity
3. **Risk Assessment**: Impact of changes on compliance/obligations
4. **Selective Optimization**: Simplify only what's truly unnecessary

### Verification Sources
- GDPR requirements: EU regulations require data deletion capabilities
- SLA definitions: Industry standard for enterprise services
- Audit logging: Common regulatory requirement for data processing
