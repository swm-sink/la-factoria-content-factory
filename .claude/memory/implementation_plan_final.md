- Fix urgent issues

### Week 5: Stabilization & Handoff
**Goal**: Ensure stability and complete knowledge transfer

#### Day 29-30: Monitoring & Optimization
- Review all metrics
- Optimize slow queries
- Fix any bugs
- Performance tuning

#### Day 31-32: Archive & Cleanup

- Cost reconciliation

#### Day 33-35: Knowledge Transfer
- Training for maintainers
- Handoff documentation
- Support transition
- Project retrospective

## Revised Technology Decisions

### Authentication Strategy
```python
# Simple but secure approach
- API keys stored hashed in database
- Key generation via admin endpoint
- Key rotation every 90 days
- Rate limiting per key
- Basic key management UI
```

### Data Migration Strategy
```python
# Safe, validated approach
1. Export with checksums
2. Validate data integrity
3. Test import with subset
4. Incremental migration
5. Rollback capability
```

### Feature Decisions (Based on User Survey)
```yaml
must_have:
  - Content generation (all 8 types)
  - API authentication
  - Basic user management
  - GDPR compliance

nice_to_have:
  - PDF export (if >50% use it)
  - Search (if >30% use it)  
  - Content history (last 30 days)

definitely_remove:
  - Complex monitoring
  - Job queues
  - Caching layers
  - Multiple export formats
  - SLA tracking
```

### Langfuse Integration (Deferred)
```yaml
phase_1:
  - Hardcoded prompts in code
  - Simple prompt selection

phase_2_later:
  - Integrate Langfuse
  - Migrate prompts
  - Version management
```

## Risk Mitigation Updates

### Technical Mitigations
1. **Railway Limits**: Monitor usage, set alerts at 80%
2. **Cold Starts**: Keep-warm endpoint, health checks
3. **Data Loss**: Automated backups to S3
4. **Performance**: CDN for static assets

### Business Mitigations
1. **User Resistance**: Involve users early and often
2. **Feature Gaps**: Rapid iteration based on feedback
3. **Downtime**: Blue-green deployment on Railway
4. **Support Load**: Self-service documentation

## Refined Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Setup time: <30 minutes (realistic)
- Deploy time: <5 minutes
- Response time: <1s (includes cold start)
- Uptime: 99% (Railway SLA)
- Test coverage: >80%

### Business Metrics  
- User satisfaction: >80%
