# Context Engineering Completeness Assessment

## What We Have ✅ (Verified with File References)

### Technical Context
- **Architecture**: FastAPI backend + React frontend verified in `/app/main.py:55-60`
- **Infrastructure**: GCP Cloud Run + Terraform verified in `/iac/main.tf:1-50`  
- **Complexity Scale**: 237 Python files, 9,723 frontend files via file count analysis
- **Dependencies**: 69 requirements verified in `/requirements.txt`

### Compliance Context
- **GDPR Requirements**: Full deletion system verified in `/app/services/user_data_deletion.py:2-8`
- **SLA Obligations**: 99.9% uptime target verified in `/docs/sla.md:10-14`
- **Audit Requirements**: Comprehensive logging verified in `/iac/modules/iam/audit_logging.tf`
- **Educational Standards**: Compliance mentioned in `CLAUDE.md:63`

### Current Features
- **Authentication**: JWT-based system verified in `/docs/feature-tracker.md:7-10`
- **Content Generation**: 8 content types via prompts in `/app/core/prompts/v1/`
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana stack in `/monitoring/`
- **Export Formats**: 5 exporters in `/app/services/export/`

## Critical Context Gaps ❌ (Unknown/Unverified)

### Business Context
- **User Base**: "1-10 users" mentioned by user but not verified in codebase
- **Business Model**: No revenue/pricing information found
- **Customer Profile**: Enterprise? Education? Government? Unknown
- **Industry Vertical**: Educational compliance hints but sector unclear

### Operational Context  
- **Current Usage**: No metrics on actual usage patterns found
- **Performance Requirements**: Beyond SLA targets, no user experience requirements
- **Budget Constraints**: No cost/resource limitations documented
- **Timeline Pressures**: No deployment deadlines or maintenance windows

### Risk Context
- **Downtime Tolerance**: SLA suggests low tolerance but business impact unknown
- **Data Sensitivity**: GDPR suggests personal data but classification level unclear
- **Compliance Drivers**: Why do they need enterprise features? Regulatory? Contractual?
- **Change Risk**: Impact of simplification on existing users/contracts unknown

### Success Metrics
- **Simplification Objectives**: User stated "simple app" but no specific targets
- **Acceptable Trade-offs**: What can be sacrificed for simplicity?
- **Measurement Criteria**: How to validate simplification success?

## Research Required for Project Success

### Priority 1: Critical Business Context
1. **Who are the actual users?** (Internal team? External customers?)
2. **Why enterprise compliance?** (Legal requirement? Customer requirement?)
3. **What drives SLA needs?** (Contractual? Regulatory? Internal?)
4. **Current usage patterns?** (Peak loads, user behavior, feature usage)

### Priority 2: Constraints & Objectives
1. **Simplification goals?** (Reduce costs? Improve maintainability? Faster development?)
2. **Risk tolerance?** (Acceptable downtime? Feature loss? Migration risks?)
3. **Timeline & resources?** (When needed? Development capacity?)
4. **Success criteria?** (How to measure if changes are beneficial?)

### Priority 3: Impact Assessment
1. **Existing commitments?** (Customer contracts? SLA agreements?)
2. **Regulatory obligations?** (Industry requirements? Geographic compliance?)
3. **Technical dependencies?** (Integrations? Data formats? APIs?)

## Recommended Research Approach

1. **Stakeholder Interviews**: Business owner, users, compliance team
2. **Usage Analytics**: Review actual system metrics and logs  
3. **Contract Review**: Examine SLA agreements and compliance obligations
4. **Risk Assessment**: Identify what absolutely cannot be changed
5. **Business Case**: Define specific simplification objectives and metrics

## Decision Framework

**Cannot proceed with simplification recommendations until:**
- Business context is understood
- Compliance drivers are identified  
- Risk tolerance is defined
- Success metrics are established

**Current Risk Level**: HIGH - Making architectural changes without business context could violate compliance, breach contracts, or harm user experience.
