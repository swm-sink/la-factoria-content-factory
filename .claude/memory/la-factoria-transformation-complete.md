## 🛠️ Essential Development Commands (11 total)

**Kept from original 66 commands:**
1. `/project` - Construction orchestrator (Enhanced for La Factoria)
2. `/help` - User guidance
3. `/task` - General task management
4. `/test` - TDD testing framework
5. `/quality` - Quality gates and validation
6. `/analyze-code` - Code analysis
7. `/monitor` - Quality monitoring
8. `/deploy` - Railway deployment
9. `/ci-run` - CI operations
10. `/monitor-setup` - Monitoring setup
11. `/secure-scan` - Security scanning

## 🔥 Deleted Enterprise Bloat (47 commands removed!)

### Categories Completely Eliminated:
- **Mega-agent spawning commands** ("100+ agents", "unlimited agents")
- **Enterprise complexity** (DAG orchestration, swarm coordination)
- **Generic templates** (not La Factoria focused)
- **Redundant specializations** (15 quality commands → 4)
- **Over-engineered solutions** (complex backup systems, etc.)

### Examples of Deleted Commands:
- `/mega-platform-builder` - "Ultimate platform builder that spawns 100+ agents"
- `/mass-transformation` - "50+ agents for framework conversion"
- `/swarm` - Generic multi-agent orchestration
- Multiple granular database commands → Single `/la-factoria-postgres`

## 📚 Educational Content Focus

### 8 Content Types Supported:
1. **Master Content Outline** - Foundation with learning objectives
2. **Podcast Script** - Audio content with engagement techniques
3. **Study Guide** - Comprehensive educational material
4. **One-Pager Summary** - Concise overview with takeaways
5. **Detailed Reading Material** - In-depth content with exercises
6. **FAQ Collection** - Question-answer pairs with depth
7. **Flashcards** - Term-definition pairs with memory techniques
8. **Reading Guide Questions** - Discussion prompts with scaffolding

### Learning Science Integration:
- **Bloom's Taxonomy** alignment
- **Age-appropriate language** assessment
- **Multi-modal learning** support (visual, auditory, kinesthetic)
- **Cognitive load theory** application
