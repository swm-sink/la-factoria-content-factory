## Validation Process Workflow

### Phase 1: Pre-Validation Setup
1. **Environment Preparation**
   - Set up clean Claude Code environment
   - Verify all dependencies are available
   - Establish baseline performance metrics
   - Document testing environment details

2. **Scope Definition**
   - Identify commands/components for validation
   - Define acceptance criteria
   - Set performance targets
   - Plan validation timeline

### Phase 2: Structural Validation
1. **Use Template**: `command-validation-checklist.md`
2. **Validation Scope**: YAML, Markdown, XML structure
3. **Success Criteria**: All structural requirements met
4. **Output**: Structural validation report

### Phase 3: Component Validation  
1. **Use Template**: `component-validation-template.md`
2. **Validation Scope**: Component functionality and integration
3. **Success Criteria**: Components work independently and together
4. **Output**: Component validation matrix

### Phase 4: Integration Testing
1. **Use Template**: `integration-testing-template.md`
2. **Validation Scope**: Command and component interactions
3. **Success Criteria**: All integrations work correctly
4. **Output**: Integration test results

### Phase 5: Performance Benchmarking
1. **Use Template**: `performance-benchmarking-template.md`
2. **Validation Scope**: Performance under various loads
3. **Success Criteria**: Performance meets targets
4. **Output**: Performance benchmark report

### Phase 6: Final Validation
1. **Aggregate Results**: Combine all validation outputs
2. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate any remaining issues
3. **Go/No-Go Decision**: Approve for production or require fixes
4. **Documentation**: Update validation status

## Validation Templates Usage Guide

### When to Use Each Template

**Component Validation Template**
- Use for: Individual component validation
- Frequency: Every new component, major component updates
- Prerequisites: Component exists and is structurally valid
- Output: Component approval/rejection decision

**Command Validation Checklist**
- Use for: Individual command validation
- Frequency: Every new command, command updates
- Prerequisites: Command exists and passes structural validation
- Output: Command readiness assessment

**Integration Testing Template**
- Use for: Testing interactions between commands/components
- Frequency: After component/command changes, before releases
- Prerequisites: Individual components/commands are validated
- Output: Integration compatibility matrix

**Performance Benchmarking Template**
- Use for: Performance validation and optimization
- Frequency: Before releases, after performance-related changes
- Prerequisites: Functional validation complete
- Output: Performance metrics and optimization recommendations

## Validation Automation

### Automated Checks (Where Possible)
```bash
# Structural validation automation
./tests/validate-command.sh [command-files]

# Component validation automation  
./tests/validate-components.sh [component-files]

# Performance benchmarking automation
./tests/benchmark-performance.sh [targets]

# Integration testing automation
./tests/run-integration-tests.sh [test-suites]
```

### Manual Review Requirements
- Security review (human expertise required)
