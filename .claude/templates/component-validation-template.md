echo "Testing component inclusion..."
# Create test command with component include
# Verify no syntax errors
```

### Test 2: Integration Testing  

```bash
# Test component with validation-framework.md
# Test component with common components (error-handling, progress-reporting)
# Verify no conflicts or duplicate functionality
```

### Test 3: Performance Testing

```bash
# Measure component load time
# Verify component doesn't significantly increase prompt size
# Test component with various input sizes
```
