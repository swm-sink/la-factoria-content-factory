- **Implementation Guidance**: Clear patterns and examples to follow
- **Quality Standards**: Built-in requirements for educational content quality

### For Stakeholders
- **System Understanding**: Clear overview of platform capabilities
- **Technical Roadmap**: Implementation phases and success criteria
- **Compliance Framework**: Security and educational standards compliance

## üîÑ Maintenance Guidelines

### Updating Architecture Documents
1. **Verify Changes**: Ensure all modifications align with "simple implementation, comprehensive context" principle
2. **Cross-Reference**: Update related examples and context files
3. **Version Control**: Track architectural decisions and rationale
4. **Validation**: Confirm implementation feasibility and educational standards compliance

### Document Quality Standards
- **Accuracy**: All technical specifications must be implementable
- **Completeness**: Cover all aspects of system design and operation
- **Clarity**: Accessible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders
- **Consistency**: Align with project standards and conventions
