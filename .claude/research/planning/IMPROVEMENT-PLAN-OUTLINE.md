# Project Finalization Plan - Outline

## Overview
Systematic finalization of Claude Code Modular Prompts project based on synthesis of current state and best practices research.

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Critical)
### 1.1 Testing Infrastructure
- Create tests/ directory structure
- Install PromptFoo testing framework
- Establish TDD workflow documentation

### 1.2 Documentation Cleanup
- Fix command count inconsistency (79 vs 67)
- Update CLAUDE.md accuracy
- Refine project status metrics

## Phase 2: File Organization (High Priority)
### 2.1 Temporary File Cleanup
- Remove TEMP-*.md files from root
- Archive research planning files
- Clean untracked files safely

### 2.2 Git State Finalization
- Commit research directory
- Organize commit history
- Prepare for final commits

## Phase 3: Testing Implementation (High Priority)
### 3.1 Command Testing Framework
- Implement PromptFoo for command validation
- Create 30-minute validation tests per research
- Establish systematic evaluation process

### 3.2 Test Coverage
- Target 80-90% coverage (per research best practices)
- Test critical command paths first
- Document testing strategy in CLAUDE.md

## Phase 4: Documentation Optimization (Medium Priority)
### 4.1 CLAUDE.md Refinement
- Optimize for token efficiency
- Ensure hierarchical organization
- Add testing strategy section

### 4.2 Consistency Validation
- Verify all counts and metrics
- Check directory structure claims
- Validate status assertions

## Phase 5: Quality Assurance (Medium Priority)
### 5.1 Anti-Pattern Compliance
- Verify no theatrical language
- Check for fabricated metrics
- Ensure factual reporting only

### 5.2 Final Review
- Holistic project assessment
- Documentation completeness check
- Quality gate validation

## Phase 6: Finalization (Low Priority)
### 6.1 Final Commits
- Use conventional commit messages
- Clean git history
- Prepare for project completion

### 6.2 Project Closure
- Final documentation updates
- Archive temporary artifacts
- Complete project status

## Success Criteria
1. 80%+ test coverage achieved
2. All documentation accurate
3. No TEMP files in root
4. Clean git history
5. All anti-pattern guidelines followed
6. Testing framework operational

## Risk Mitigation
- Commit frequently to preserve progress
- Use conventional commit messages
- Test incrementally to avoid large failures
- Maintain factual reporting throughout
