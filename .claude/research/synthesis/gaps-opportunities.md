**Opportunity**:
```python
# Command testing framework
class ClaudeCommandTest:
    def test_command_output(self):
        result = execute_command("/build-feature user-auth")
        assert "created auth module" in result
        assert files_exist(["auth.js", "auth.test.js"])
```

### 4. Advanced Error Recovery

**Gap**:

### 7. Natural Language Programming

**Next Level**:
```markdown
"Build a user authentication system with email verification,
password reset, and rate limiting. Use JWT tokens and
include comprehensive tests."

→ Complete implementation with all features
```

### 8. Predictive Development

**Future State**:
- Anticipate next development steps
- Suggest refactoring opportunities
