# Claude Code Research Collection

This directory contains research on Claude Code implementations, focusing on native agentic abilities and prompt/context engineering patterns.

## Research Scope

**Focus**: Implementations demonstrating Claude's native agentic abilities:
- Tool usage (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, WebSearch, etc.)
- Multi-step planning with TodoWrite
- Self-directed problem solving
- Context management via CLAUDE.md
- Slash command creation and usage
- Autonomous workflow execution
