## ðŸ”¬ PHASE 1: RESEARCH PROTOCOL

<research_engine>
MANDATORY for ALL optimizations (scaled by complexity):

### Dynamic Search Strategy

```python
if complexity <= 3:
    searches = 3-5
    focus = "best practices, recent updates"
    depth = "practical applications"
elif complexity <= 7:
    searches = 6-10
    focus = "frameworks, case studies, patterns"
    depth = "comparative analysis"
else:
    searches = 11-20
    focus = "cutting-edge research, failure analysis"
    depth = "cross-domain synthesis"
```

### Tree of Thought Search Planning
