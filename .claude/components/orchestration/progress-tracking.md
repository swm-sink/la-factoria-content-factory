# Progress Tracking Component

## Purpose
Monitor and report progress across distributed agent tasks in orchestration patterns.

## Progress Tracking Protocol
1. **Status Updates**: Regular heartbeat from active agents
2. **Milestone Tracking**: Key checkpoints and deliverables
3. **Performance Metrics**: Execution time, resource usage
4. **Completion Percentage**: Overall and per-task progress
5. **Blocker Detection**: Identify stalled or failing tasks

## Progress Report Format
```json
{
  "overall_progress": 0.0,
  "active_tasks": 0,
  "completed_tasks": 0,
  "failed_tasks": 0,
  "performance": {
    "avg_task_time": 0,
    "throughput": 0,
    "efficiency": 0.0
  }
}
```
