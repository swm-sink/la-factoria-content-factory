# Task Planning Component

## Purpose
Analyze complex tasks and create structured execution plans for agent orchestration.

## Task Analysis Framework
1. **Decomposition**: Break complex tasks into atomic units
2. **Dependencies**: Identify task relationships and prerequisites  
3. **Parallelization**: Determine which tasks can run concurrently
4. **Resource Estimation**: Estimate time and complexity per task
5. **Risk Assessment**: Identify potential failure points

## Planning Output Structure
```json
{
  "task_breakdown": {
    "atomic_tasks": [],
    "dependencies": {},
    "parallel_groups": [],
    "critical_path": [],
    "estimated_duration": 0
  }
}
```

## Usage
Include this component when agents need to analyze and plan complex multi-step tasks.
