  <step name="Formulate a Plan">
    <description>
      Before making any changes, formulate a detailed, step-by-step implementation plan.
      The plan should be clear, logical, and account for potential risks or edge cases.
      For each step, describe the action to be taken and the expected outcome.
    </description>
    <output>
      Present the plan to the user in a structured format (e.g., a numbered list).
      The plan should be comprehensive enough that another developer could execute it.
