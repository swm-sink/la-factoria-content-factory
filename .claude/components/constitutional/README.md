# Constitutional AI Components

Core constitutional AI framework components that provide foundational ethical reasoning, safety alignment, and democratic governance for all Claude Code commands.

## Overview

This directory contains the fundamental constitutional AI infrastructure that powers ethical decision-making across the entire Claude Code Modular Prompts framework. These components are embedded into commands and the core system rather than being standalone commands.

## Components

### Core Framework
- `constitutional-framework.md` - Main constitutional AI implementation
- `wisdom-alignment.md` - Contemplative wisdom integration
- `democratic-governance.md` - Participatory constitutional design
- `safety-layers.md` - Multi-layered safety architecture

### Integration Patterns
- `command-integration.md` - How to embed constitutional AI into commands
- `evaluation-metrics.md` - Assessment frameworks for constitutional compliance
- `governance-protocols.md` - Democratic oversight and updating procedures

## Usage

Constitutional components are automatically integrated into all commands through the core system. Commands can reference specific constitutional principles and safety mechanisms as needed.

## Integration with CLAUDE.md

The constitutional framework is embedded into the main CLAUDE.md system prompt to ensure all commands operate within ethical and safety bounds while maintaining democratic legitimacy.
