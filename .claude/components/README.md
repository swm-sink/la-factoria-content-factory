# Claude Prompt Factory Components

Core framework components that provide foundational capabilities for all Claude Code commands. Components are reusable architectural building blocks that implement sophisticated AI frameworks, safety systems, and intelligence capabilities.

## Architecture Principles

### Component vs Command Distinction

**Components** are foundational frameworks and architectures:
- Implement complex AI/ML methodologies 
- Provide reusable capabilities across multiple commands
- Focus on "how it works" - the underlying mechanisms
- Named as `*-framework.md` or `*-architecture.md`
- Located in `/components/` directories organized by function

**Commands** are action-oriented tools:
- Trigger specific tasks and workflows
- Leverage framework components to accomplish goals  
- Focus on "what to do" - the intended actions
- Named as descriptive action verbs (`/reason-react`, `/optimize-prompt`)
- Located in `/commands/` directories organized by domain

### Naming Conventions

#### Framework Components
- **Cognitive Systems**: `cognitive-architecture.md`, `meta-learning-framework.md`
- **Reasoning Systems**: `react-framework.md`, `tree-of-thoughts-framework.md`
- **Optimization Systems**: `textgrad-framework.md`, `dspy-framework.md`

## Integration Architecture

### Component Loading System
Components are automatically loaded into the main system through the CLAUDE.md import system:

```markdown
## Framework Components Integration

### Constitutional AI Foundation
@import ../components/constitutional/constitutional-framework.md
@import ../components/constitutional/wisdom-alignment.md

### Intelligence and Learning Frameworks  
@import ../components/intelligence/cognitive-architecture.md
@import ../components/learning/meta-learning.md
```

### Command Integration Pattern
Commands reference framework components to leverage their capabilities:

```xml
<command>reason-react</command>
<params>
  <!-- Framework Component Reference -->
  <framework_component>@components/reasoning/react-reasoning</framework_component>
  <constitutional_compliance>true</constitutional_compliance>
  
  <!-- Command-specific configuration -->
  <problem_description>User-provided problem</problem_description>
  <reasoning_depth>detailed</reasoning_depth>
</params>
```

### Dependency Resolution
Components can depend on other components, creating a hierarchical architecture:
- Constitutional AI provides foundational safety for all components
- Intelligence frameworks enhance reasoning and optimization components
- Quality assurance validates all other component operations
