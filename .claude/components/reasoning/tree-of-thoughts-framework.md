  <step name="Tree of Thoughts Framework">
    <description>
      Implement Tree of Thoughts reasoning for systematic exploration of multiple solution paths with deliberate branching and evaluation.
      
      Enable comprehensive problem-solving through structured exploration of solution space with comparative analysis.
    </description>
    
    <o>
      Provide systematic Tree of Thoughts analysis:
      - **Problem Decomposition**: [break into explorable dimensions]
      - **Solution Branches**: [multiple distinct approaches with reasoning]
      - **Branch Evaluation**: [comparative analysis of each path]
      - **Synthesis Strategy**: [combine best elements from different branches]
      - **Implementation Plan**: [practical steps for optimal solution]
      
      Maintain clear branching logic with transparent evaluation criteria throughout.
