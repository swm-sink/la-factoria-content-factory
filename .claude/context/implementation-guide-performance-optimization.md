# Performance Optimization Implementation Guide

**Target Audience**: Claude Code command developers and system integrators  
**Implementation Scope**: 30 active commands + 49 deprecated commands  
**Performance Goals**: 40% context reduction, 2.39x speed improvement, sub-100ms loading  

## Quick Start Implementation

### Step 1: Enable Performance Optimization Framework
Add performance optimization import to any command file:

```markdown
<!-- At the top of command file, after standard DRY components -->
<include>context/performance-optimization-architecture.md</include>
<include>context/layer-1-core-essential.md</include>
<include>context/contextual-memory-manager.md</include>
<include>context/batchprompt-methodology.md</include>
```

### Step 2: Command Complexity Assessment
Evaluate your command's complexity to determine optimization strategy:

```yaml
complexity_assessment:
  simple_commands (1-3):
    examples: ["/help", "basic /query", "single-file /task"]
    optimization: "maximum_parallelization + minimal_context"
    expected_speedup: "3.2x"
    
  moderate_commands (4-6):
    examples: ["/task with dependencies", "/auto routing", "focused /protocol"]
    optimization: "selective_context + structured_parallel"
    expected_speedup: "2.4x"
    
  complex_commands (7-10):
    examples: ["multi-file /protocol", "/swarm coordination", "architectural /task"]
    optimization: "full_context + sot_prompting + intelligent_batching"
    expected_speedup: "1.8x"
```

### Step 3: Apply Context Layering Strategy
Replace full context loading with semantic layers:

**Before (Traditional):**
```markdown
<include>context/git-history-antipatterns.md</include>
<include>context/llm-antipatterns.md</include>
<include>context/modular-components.md</include>
<include>context/orchestration-patterns.md</include>
<include>context/prompt-engineering-best-practices.md</include>
<include>context/experimental-framework-guide.md</include>
<include>context/quality-assessment-report.md</include>
```

**After (Optimized):**
```markdown
<!-- Layer 1: Always loaded (8K tokens) -->
<include>context/layer-1-core-essential.md</include>

<!-- Layer 2: Conditional loading based on command type -->
<conditional_include command_type="moderate|complex">
  <include>context/layer-2-contextual-adaptive.md</include>
</conditional_include>

<!-- Layer 3: On-demand for complex operations only -->
<conditional_include complexity_score=">7">
  <include>context/layer-3-deep-context.md</include>
</conditional_include>
```

## Command-Specific Implementation Examples

### Simple Command Optimization: /help Command
```markdown
---
description: Display help information with optimized loading
performance_tier: "simple"
context_layers: ["layer_1_core"]
---

<command_file>
  <claude_prompt>
    <prompt>
      <!-- Performance optimized context loading -->
      <include>context/layer-1-core-essential.md</include>
      
      <!-- Parallel execution enabled -->
      <parallel_execution enabled="true" max_tools="3">
        <tool_group>Read, Grep, LS</tool_group>
      </parallel_execution>
      
      You are providing help information with performance optimization.
      
      Execute with maximum parallelization:
      1. Read available commands (parallel with step 2)
      2. Grep for command patterns (parallel with step 1)  
      3. Format and display results
      
      Expected execution time: <500ms
    </prompt>
  </claude_prompt>
</command_file>
```

### Moderate Command Optimization: /task Command
```markdown
---
description: Focused TDD workflow with balanced optimization
performance_tier: "moderate"
context_layers: ["layer_1_core", "layer_2_contextual"]
---

<command_file>
  <claude_prompt>
    <prompt>
      <!-- Layered context loading -->
      <include>context/layer-1-core-essential.md</include>
      <include>context/layer-2-contextual-adaptive.md</include>
      
      <!-- Selective component loading -->
      <conditional_include>
        <include>components/testing/tdd-cycle-enhanced.md</include>
        <include>components/security/owasp-compliance.md</include>
        <include>components/actions/parallel-execution.md</include>
      </conditional_include>
      
      <!-- BatchPrompt methodology -->
      <batch_execution strategy="moderate_command">
        <parallel_tools>Read, Write, Edit, Bash</parallel_tools>
        <dependency_management enabled="true"/>
      </batch_execution>
      
      Execute enhanced TDD workflow with performance optimization:
      
      **Phase 1: Analysis (Parallel Information Gathering)**
      - Analyze requirements (parallel with codebase discovery)
      - Discover existing codebase structure

      - Create focused integration tests
      - Design security validation tests
      - Plan performance benchmarks
      
      **Phase 3: Implementation (Optimized)**
      - Implement with parallel validation
      - Apply real-time quality gates
      - Execute with circuit breaker patterns
      
      Expected execution time: <1200ms
      Token budget: 20,000 tokens
    </prompt>
  </claude_prompt>
</command_file>
```

  <claude_prompt>
    <prompt>
      <!-- Full context loading with compression -->
      <include>context/layer-1-core-essential.md</include>
      <include>context/layer-2-contextual-adaptive.md</include>
      <include>context/layer-3-deep-context.md</include>
      
      <!-- Skeleton-of-Thought prompting enabled -->
      <sot_prompting enabled="true" complexity_threshold="7">
        <skeleton_generation>
          <phase_1>Task decomposition into parallel components</phase_1>
          <phase_2>Dependency mapping and coordination planning</phase_2>
          <phase_3>Parallel execution with intelligent batching</phase_3>
        </skeleton_generation>
      </sot_prompting>
      
      <!-- Advanced parallel coordination -->
      <parallel_execution strategy="complex_coordination">
        <agent_swarm size="3-5"/>
        <coordination_pattern>stigmergy</coordination_pattern>
        <failure_handling>circuit_breaker</failure_handling>
      </parallel_execution>
      
      Execute multi-agent coordination with SoT optimization:
      
      **Skeleton Generation Phase (5ms)**
      - Decompose complex task into agent-suitable subtasks
      - Map dependencies and coordination requirements
      - Plan parallel execution with optimal resource allocation
      
      **Parallel Agent Coordination (2.39x speedup)**
      - Execute specialized agents simultaneously
      - Coordinate through stigmergy patterns
      - Apply circuit breaker for resilience
      
      **Result Synthesis (Optimized)**
      - Aggregate results with parallel processing
      - Validate outcomes with comprehensive checks
      - Report with confidence intervals
      
      Expected execution time: <2000ms
      Token budget: 35,000 tokens
      Expected speedup: 1.8x over sequential execution
    </prompt>
  </claude_prompt>
</command_file>
```
