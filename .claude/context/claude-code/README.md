### Key Features

- **Specialized Expertise**: Each agent focuses on specific educational content types
- **Quality Assurance Pipeline**: Multi-layered validation for educational effectiveness
- **Adaptive Coordination**: Intelligent task distribution and resource allocation
- **Continuous Learning**: Agents improve based on outcomes and feedback

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Basic Agent Usage

```bash
# Generate a complete educational content set
/orchestrate-content "Python Programming Basics" --grade-level="high-school" --duration="2-weeks"

# Generate specific content type
/generate-study-guide "Machine Learning Fundamentals" --audience="undergraduate"

# Quality validation for existing content
/validate-content --type="study-guide" --standards="educational,factual,age-appropriate"
```

### 2. Multi-Agent Workflows

```bash
# Run comprehensive content generation pipeline
/content-pipeline "Data Science Introduction" --complete-set --quality-validated

# Optimize existing content with multiple agents
/optimize-content --agents="quality,factual,educational" --target-score=0.85
```

### 3. Agent Orchestration

```bash
# Custom agent coordination for complex tasks
/orchestrate --agents="research,outline,study-guide,validation" --coordination="hierarchical"

# Swarm intelligence for content optimization
/swarm-optimize --content-type="all" --optimization-target="educational-effectiveness"
```

## 📊 Educational Content Types

The agent system generates 8 core educational content types:

1. **Master Content Outline** - Foundation structure with learning objectives
2. **Podcast Script** - Conversational audio content with speaker notes
3. **Study Guide** - Comprehensive educational material with key concepts
4. **One-Pager Summary** - Concise overview with essential takeaways
5. **Detailed Reading Material** - In-depth content with examples and exercises
6. **FAQ Collection** - Question-answer pairs covering common topics
7. **Flashcards** - Term-definition pairs for memorization and review
8. **Reading Guide Questions** - Discussion questions for comprehension

## 🎯 Quality Standards

All generated content must meet:

- **Quality Threshold**: Minimum 0.70 overall score
- **Educational Value**: ≥ 0.75 for learning effectiveness
- **Factual Accuracy**: ≥ 0.85 for information reliability
- **Age Appropriateness**: Language and complexity matching target audience
- **Pedagogical Structure**: Following educational best practices

## 🔗 Integration Points
