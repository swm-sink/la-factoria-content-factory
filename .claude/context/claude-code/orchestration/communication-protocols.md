## 🔄 Communication Patterns

### 1. Synchronous Communication Pattern

**Use Case**: Real-time coordination, immediate validation, critical decision making

```yaml
synchronous_pattern:
  characteristics:
    - Immediate response required
    - Real-time coordination necessary
    - Critical quality gate validation
    - Emergency error handling
  
  protocol:
    initiation:
      - Sender establishes direct communication channel
      - Recipient acknowledges availability
      - Communication context established
      - Priority and urgency confirmed
    
    exchange:
      - Message sent with immediate delivery requirement
      - Recipient processes message and prepares response
      - Response sent within defined time window
      - Confirmation of message receipt and understanding
    
    completion:
      - Communication outcome recorded
      - Next steps agreed upon
      - Communication channel maintained or closed
      - Results propagated to relevant agents
  
  examples:
    quality_gate_validation:

      participants: ["Content Generator", "Quality Validator", "Orchestrator"]
      flow:
        - Content generator submits for validation
        - Quality validator immediately assesses content
        - Results communicated in real-time
        - Generator receives immediate feedback
        - Orchestrator notified of validation outcome
    
    emergency_coordination:
      scenario: "Agent failure during critical content generation"
      participants: ["Failed Agent", "Backup Agent", "Orchestrator"]
      flow:
        - Agent failure detected immediately
        - Orchestrator initiates emergency coordination
        - Backup agent activated in real-time
        - Task state transferred synchronously
