## Overview

Agent orchestration involves coordinating multiple specialized agents to accomplish complex tasks that exceed the capabilities of individual agents. This guide consolidates proven patterns from distributed systems, multi-agent coordination, and workflow orchestration research.

### Key Principles

- **Specialization**: Each agent has specific capabilities and responsibilities
- **Coordination**: Agents work together through well-defined protocols
- **Scalability**: Patterns scale effectively with task complexity
- **Fault Tolerance**: Systems gracefully handle failures and errors
- **Emergence**: Complex behaviors emerge from simple interactions

## Core Orchestration Patterns

### 1. Swarm Intelligence Pattern

**Purpose**: Coordinate multiple agents using emergent behavior principles for distributed problem-solving.

**Key Characteristics**:
- No central coordinator
- Self-organizing behavior
- Local interactions create global patterns
- Stigmergy (indirect coordination through environment modification)

**Implementation**:
```json
{
  "pattern": "swarm",
  "agents": {
    "count": "5-15",
    "specialization": "dynamic",
    "communication": "pheromone_trails"
  },
  "coordination": {
    "method": "stigmergy",
    "self_organization": true,
    "emergence": true
  }
}
```

**Best Use Cases**:
- Exploration and discovery tasks
- Optimization problems
- Complex analysis requiring multiple perspectives
- Research and knowledge synthesis

**Example Command**: `/swarm Analyze codebase for performance issues using multiple specialized agents`

### 2. Hierarchical Orchestration Pattern

**Purpose**: Organize agents in tree-like hierarchy with parent-child relationships and delegation.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Clear command structure
- Parent agents delegate to children
- Context inheritance through hierarchy
- Bottom-up result aggregation

**Implementation**:
```json
{
  "pattern": "hierarchical",
  "hierarchy": {
    "root": "project_coordinator",
    "levels": {
      "team_leads": ["subsystem_owners"],
      "specialists": ["feature_developers"],
      "workers": ["task_executors"]
    }
  },
  "delegation": {
    "mode": "capability_based",
    "context_inheritance": true,
    "result_aggregation": "bottom_up"
  }
}
```

**Best Use Cases**:
- Large-scale projects
- Complex system development
- Multi-team coordination
- Enterprise-level implementations

**Example Command**: `/hierarchical Build e-commerce platform with teams for frontend, backend, and infrastructure`

### 3. Pipeline Pattern

**Purpose**: Execute sequential processing pipeline with specialized agents at each stage.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Linear workflow execution
- Data transformation between stages
- Stage-specific agent specialization
- Quality gates and validation

**Implementation**:
```json
{
  "pattern": "pipeline",
  "stages": [
    {
      "name": "analysis",
      "agent": "analyzer",
      "input_schema": "raw_requirements",
      "output_schema": "structured_analysis"
    },
    {
      "name": "design",
      "agent": "architect",
      "depends_on": ["analysis"],
      "quality_gates": ["design_review"]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Best Use Cases**:
- CI/CD workflows
- Data processing pipelines
- Sequential transformations
- Quality-gated processes

**Example Commands**:
```bash
/pipeline Code Analysis → Security Scan → Test Generation → Documentation → Deployment
/pipeline create ci/cd --config "jenkinsfile"
/pipeline run "deployment-pipeline" --monitor
```

### 4. Map-Reduce Pattern

**Purpose**: Distribute large tasks across parallel agents and aggregate results.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Work partitioning (map phase)
- Parallel execution
- Result aggregation (reduce phase)
- Load balancing and fault tolerance

**Implementation**:
```json
{
  "pattern": "map_reduce",
  "partitioning": {
    "strategy": "file_based|size_based|complexity_based",
    "chunk_size": "adaptive",
    "load_balancing": "dynamic"
  },
  "execution": {
    "mappers": "parallel_agents",
    "reducers": "aggregation_agents",
    "fault_tolerance": "retry_with_backoff"
  }
}
```

**Best Use Cases**:
- Large-scale analysis
- Batch processing
- Distributed computation
- Performance-critical tasks

**Example Command**: `/map-reduce Analyze all 500 files in codebase for security vulnerabilities`

### 5. DAG Orchestration Pattern

**Purpose**: Execute tasks using Directed Acyclic Graph with adaptive agent spawning.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Complex dependency management
- Parallel execution optimization
- Conditional branching
- Dynamic task modification

**Implementation**:
```json
{
  "pattern": "dag",
  "graph": {
    "nodes": "tasks_with_dependencies",
    "edges": "dependency_relationships",
    "validation": "acyclic_verification"
  },
  "execution": {
    "scheduling": "topological_sort",
    "parallelization": "dependency_aware",
    "adaptation": "runtime_modification"
  }
}
```

**Best Use Cases**:
- Complex workflows
- Conditional execution paths
- Dependency-heavy processes
- Adaptive task orchestration

**Example Command**: `/dag-orchestrate Build and deploy system with conditional testing based on code changes`

      - swarm: "Collaborative problem-solving"
      - pipeline: "Quality-gated delivery"

  coordination: hierarchical
  execution: 
    - parallel_streams: map_reduce
    - sequential_stages: pipeline
    - adaptive_workflows: dag
    - exploration_tasks: swarm
```

## Best Practices

### Pattern Selection Guidelines

1. **Task Complexity**: 
   - Simple sequential → Pipeline
   - Complex dependencies → DAG
   - Exploration/research → Swarm
   - Large-scale processing → Map-Reduce
   - Multi-team coordination → Hierarchical

2. **Team Structure**:
   - Flat organizations → Swarm or Map-Reduce
   - Hierarchical organizations → Hierarchical
   - Cross-functional teams → Pipeline or DAG

3. **Performance Requirements**:
   - High throughput → Map-Reduce
   - Low latency → Pipeline
   - Adaptive performance → DAG or Swarm

### Communication Protocols

1. **Synchronous Communication**:
   - Direct agent-to-agent messaging
   - Request-response patterns
   - Blocking operations for critical coordination

2. **Asynchronous Communication**:
   - Message queues and event systems
   - Non-blocking operations
   - Fire-and-forget for non-critical updates

3. **Indirect Communication**:
   - Shared workspace (stigmergy)
   - Environment modification
   - Pheromone trails and markers

### Error Handling Strategies

1. **Graceful Degradation**:
   - Continue with reduced capabilities
   - Fallback to simpler patterns
   - Partial result acceptance

2. **Retry Mechanisms**:
   - Exponential backoff
   - Circuit breaker patterns
   - Alternative agent assignment

3. **Recovery Procedures**:
   - Checkpoint and rollback
   - State reconstruction
   - Partial workflow restart

### Performance Optimization

1. **Load Balancing**:
   - Dynamic work distribution
   - Capability-based assignment
   - Resource utilization monitoring

2. **Caching Strategies**:
   - Result memoization
   - Intermediate state storage
   - Cross-agent knowledge sharing

3. **Resource Management**:
   - Memory and CPU limits
   - Timeout configuration
   - Priority-based scheduling

### Quality Assurance

1. **Validation Gates**:
   - Input/output validation
   - Quality thresholds
   - Compliance checking

2. **Monitoring and Metrics**:
   - Real-time progress tracking
   - Performance metrics collection
   - Anomaly detection

3. **Testing Strategies**:
   - Unit testing for individual agents
   - Integration testing for patterns
   - End-to-end workflow validation
