# LLM Anti-Patterns and Best Practices (2025)

## Overview
Comprehensive research on common pitfalls in LLM development and prompt engineering to prevent hallucinations and ensure reliable AI systems.

## Critical Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. Over-Reliance on Non-Deterministic Outputs
**Problem**: LLMs are inherently non-deterministic - same input â‰  same output
**Risk**: Errors compound in multi-step reasoning chains
**Solution**: Implement deterministic validation layers and multiple sampling strategies

### 2. Hallucination Tolerance
**Problem**: ~5% token hallucination rate (1 in 20 tokens may be incorrect)
**Specific Risk**: LLMs invent non-existent methods, libraries, or APIs
**Solution**: 
- Always verify generated code against official documentation
- Implement automated fact-checking for API references
- Use established libraries over bleeding-edge ones

### 3. Insufficient Observability
**Problem**: LLM behavior debugging is immature compared to traditional software
**Solution**: Implement comprehensive logging, monitoring, and tracing systems

### 4. Poor Review Processes
**Anti-Pattern**: "If I have to review every line, it's faster to write myself"
**Solution**: Invest in code review skills and establish review protocols

## Prompt Engineering Anti-Patterns

### 1. Vague Instructions
**Bad**: "Handle client intake"
**Good**: "Collect client name, email, project type, budget range, and timeline. Validate email format. Store in structured JSON."

### 2. Model-Agnostic Prompting
**Problem**: Different models require different approaches
- **GPT-4o**: Short, structured prompts with hashtags/numbered lists
- **Claude 4**: XML tags like `<task>`, `<context>` for semantic clarity
- **Gemini 1.5**: Hierarchical outline structure

### 3. Poor Context Placement
- **Claude**: Documents at top of prompt
- **GPT**: Instructions at top and bottom of documents
- **Gemini**: Experiment with placement

### 4. Over-Repetition of Examples
**Problem**: Model memorizes specific patterns instead of learning principles
**Solution**: Use diverse examples that teach general concepts

### 5. Unstructured Formatting
**Problem**: Free-form text without clear boundaries
**Solution**: Use XML tags, especially for Claude (`<instructions>`, `<examples>`, `<output_format>`)

### 6. Token Inefficiency
**Anti-Pattern**: Verbose, repetitive prompts
**Solution**: Abstract patterns, remove redundancy, aim for 40% token reduction

### 7. Missing Security Measures
**Problem**: No defensive prompting against adversarial inputs
**Solution**: Implement prompt scaffolding and input validation

### 8. No Version Control
**Problem**: Lost track of what works
**Solution**: Version prompts like code, track performance metrics

### 9. Isolated Development
**Problem**: Writing prompts without feedback
**Solution**: Use LLMs to review and improve prompts

### 10. No Testing Framework
**Problem**: Deploy without validation
**Solution**: A/B test prompts, monitor real-world performance

## Best Practices for 2025

### 1. Robust Error Handling
- Implement multiple validation layers
- Use try-catch patterns for LLM calls
- Have fallback strategies for common failures

### 2. Domain-Specific Fine-Tuning
- Use models aligned with your specific domain
- Ensure training data is bias-free and representative
- Prefer specialized models over general-purpose ones

### 3. Chain-of-Reasoning Approaches
- Break complex prompts into smaller, verifiable steps
- Use "LLM as judge" for intermediate validation
- Implement step-by-step verification

### 4. Hybrid Deterministic Systems
- Combine LLMs with deterministic tools (APIs, databases)
- Use LLMs for reasoning, deterministic systems for actions
- Prefer established, well-documented libraries

### 5. Data Privacy and Compliance
- Fine-tune on proprietary data for compliance
- Never expose sensitive information to external models
- Implement data anonymization and encryption

### 6. Choose Boring Technology
**Principle**: "Choose boring technology"
**Rationale**: LLMs are better trained on established, widely-used libraries
**Implementation**: Prefer mature, well-documented frameworks

### 7. Continuous Learning Loops
- Implement feedback mechanisms
- Use developer corrections as training data
- Build iterative improvement systems

## Context Engineering Principles

### 1. Comprehensive Documentation
- Include official API documentation
- Reference high-quality open source examples
- Maintain updated best practices

### 2. Anti-Hallucination Measures
- Always verify against authoritative sources
- Cross-reference multiple documentation sources
- Implement automated fact-checking

### 3. DRY Documentation Principles
- Centralize common patterns
- Reference rather than duplicate
- Maintain single source of truth

### 4. Quality Metrics
- Track hallucination rates
- Monitor prompt effectiveness
- Measure code quality outcomes

## Implementation Guidelines

### For Code Generation
1. Start with official documentation examples
2. Reference high-star open source projects
3. Validate generated code against test suites
4. Implement automated quality checks

### For Educational Content
1. Ground in established pedagogical frameworks
2. Reference authoritative educational sources
3. Implement learning objective validation
4. Test with real learners

### For System Architecture
1. Follow established architectural patterns
2. Reference production-tested implementations
3. Implement comprehensive monitoring
4. Plan for failure scenarios
