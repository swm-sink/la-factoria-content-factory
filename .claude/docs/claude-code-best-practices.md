# Claude Code Best Practices & Context

## Overview
This document captures research and best practices for Claude Code usage, serving as context for this modular prompts project.

## Core Claude Code Features

### Memory System
- **Project Memory**: `./CLAUDE.md` - Team-shared instructions for project architecture and workflows
- **User Memory**: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` - Personal preferences across all projects  
- **Import System**: Use `@path/to/import` syntax with max 5 hops depth
- **Quick Memory**: Start input with `#` to quickly add memories

### Settings Hierarchy
1. Enterprise policies (highest precedence)
2. Command line arguments
3. Local project settings
4. Shared project settings
5. User settings (lowest precedence)

### Tool System
- **Available Tools**: Bash, Edit, Glob, Read, Write, Task, WebFetch, etc.
- **Permissions**: Configured via `settings.json` allow/deny lists
- **Hooks**: Custom shell commands that execute before/after tool calls

## Best Practices for This Project

### Project Structure
```

└── tests/                      # Test suite
```

### Command Design Principles
1. **Be Specific**: Use clear, precise instructions in commands
2. **Tool Declaration**: Always declare required tools in YAML frontmatter
3. **Error Handling**: Include proper error handling and validation
4. **Security First**: Follow defensive security principles
5. **Composability**: Design commands to work together

### Memory Organization
- Use markdown headings and bullet points for structure
- Organize by logical groupings (core, development, security, etc.)
- Keep commands focused and single-purpose
- Include usage examples and expected outputs

### Context Engineering
- Load context hierarchically (general → specific)
- Use imports to avoid duplication
- Keep context relevant and up-to-date
- Document command relationships and dependencies

## Security Guidelines

### Defensive Principles
- Never generate code that could be used maliciously
- Always validate inputs and sanitize outputs
- Use principle of least privilege for tool permissions
- Include security reviews in development process

### Tool Permissions
- Grant minimum necessary permissions
- Use specific patterns rather than wildcards when possible
- Review permissions regularly
- Document permission rationale

## Performance Optimization

### Context Management
- Use selective imports to minimize context loading
- Implement caching for frequently used patterns
- Optimize command discovery and loading
- Monitor context window usage

### Command Efficiency
- Target 50-80 lines per command for optimal performance
- Use efficient tool combinations
- Minimize redundant operations
- Implement performance benchmarking

## Testing Strategy

### Test-Driven Development
1. Write tests before implementing commands
2. Include both unit and integration tests
3. Test error conditions and edge cases
4. Maintain high test coverage (80%+)

### Test Categories
- **Unit Tests**: Individual command functionality
- **Integration Tests**: Command interactions and workflows
- **Security Tests**: Input validation and safety checks
- **Performance Tests**: Response times and resource usage

## Documentation Standards

### Command Documentation
- Clear description and usage examples
- Required tools and permissions
- Input/output specifications
- Error conditions and handling

### Project Documentation
- Keep README focused and actionable
- Include quick start guide
- Document common workflows
- Provide troubleshooting guide

## Quality Gates

### Before Merging
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet targets
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code follows style guidelines

### Monitoring
- Track command usage patterns
- Monitor performance metrics
- Review security audit logs
- Gather user feedback
