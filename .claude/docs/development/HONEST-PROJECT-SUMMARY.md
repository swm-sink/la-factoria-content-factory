# What This Project ACTUALLY Is - Honest Summary

## The Truth About This "Adaptation Engine"

**This is a collection of markdown templates, not an automation engine.**

### What You're Actually Getting:
1. **102 Command Templates** (64 active, 38 deprecated) - Markdown files with [INSERT_XXX] placeholders
2. **7 Guide Commands** - Commands that provide checklists and instructions (not automation)
3. **71 Component Fragments** - Reusable prompt pieces you can copy
4. **Documentation** - Guides about anti-patterns and best practices
5. **A Setup Script** - Copies files to your project (that's all)

### What This Does NOT Do:
- ❌ **No automatic adaptation** - Everything is manual
- ❌ **No placeholder replacement** - You use Find & Replace in your editor
- ❌ **No tech stack detection** - You tell it what you use
- ❌ **No state tracking** - It can't remember previous runs
- ❌ **No file modification** - Claude Code commands can't edit files

## How to ACTUALLY Use This

### 1. Install (2 minutes)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/swm-sink/claude-code-modular-prompts
cd claude-code-modular-prompts && ./setup.sh ../your-project
```
This copies template files to your project. That's it.

### 2. Get Instructions (5 minutes)
```bash
# In Claude Code:
/adapt-to-project
```
This gives you a checklist of manual work to do.

### 3. Do Manual Work (30-60 minutes)
- Open files in your editor
- Find every [INSERT_XXX] placeholder
- Replace with your actual values
- Delete commands you don't need
- Save your changes

### 4. Verify (5 minutes)
```bash
/validate-adaptation
```
This gives you commands to check for missed placeholders.

## The Real Value

**Without this library:**
- Start from scratch
- Learn Claude Code quirks the hard way
- Discover anti-patterns through failures
- Build your command library over months

**With this library:**
- Start with tested templates
- Avoid documented anti-patterns
- Customize proven patterns
- Have a working set in an afternoon

## Honest Assessment

- **Good Architecture**: Yes, the templates are well-designed
- **Saves Time**: Yes, if you understand it's manual work
- **Production Ready**: The templates work, but YOU customize them
- **Automation Level**: Zero - it's all manual

## Who This Is For

✅ **Good fit if you:**
- Want proven Claude Code templates
- Don't mind manual customization
- Value learning from others' experience
- Understand this is a starting point

❌ **Not for you if you:**
- Expected automated adaptation
- Want a 5-minute setup
- Need everything done for you
- Don't want to edit files manually

## Bottom Line

This is a **template library with good documentation**, not an intelligent adaptation engine. The "meta-commands" are just commands that print instructions for you to follow manually.

If you're okay with that, it's actually quite useful. The templates are good, the anti-pattern documentation is valuable, and having 79 starting points is better than starting from scratch.

Just don't expect magic. Expect templates and guides.
