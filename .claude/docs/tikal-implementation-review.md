- **`/tikal-validate-quality`**: Validates content quality against educational standards
- **`/tikal-generate`**: Generates content using optimized templates
- **`/tikal-analyze-prompts`**: Analyzes prompts for optimization opportunities
- **`/tikal-templates`**: Manages and optimizes prompt templates
- **`/tikal-test-prompts`**: Tests and validates prompt templates
- **`/tikal-optimize-context`**: Optimizes context data for efficiency
- **`/tikal-monitor`**: Monitors performance metrics

### 2. **Optimized Prompt Templates** (4 templates)
Located in `.claude/templates/tikal/`:

- **`study-guide-optimized.md`**: 30% token reduction, educational standards integrated
- **`flashcards-optimized.md`**: 40% token reduction, cognitive science principles
- **`master-outline-optimized.md`**: 35% token reduction, Bloom's taxonomy integration
- **`podcast-script-optimized.md`**: 25% token reduction, conversational optimization

### 3. **Reusable Components** (4 components)
Located in `.claude/components/tikal/`:

- **`educational-standards.md`**: Age-appropriate guidelines, learning frameworks
- **`quality-assessment.md`**: Quality metrics and scoring algorithms
- **`prompt-validation.md`**: Schema validation and testing frameworks
- **`security-validation.md`**: Input sanitization and safety measures

### 4. **Project Context**
- **`tikal-project.md`**: Comprehensive project understanding and architecture

## Key Achievements

### Token Efficiency
- **Average Reduction**: 32.5% across optimized templates
