# Tree of Thought: Project Cleanup Strategy

## Problem Space Analysis

**Current Situation**: Complex project with 2,000+ files across multiple directories, scattered configurations, and duplicate command structures requiring systematic cleanup.

**Goal**: Clean, compliant Claude Code project with high-quality commands, proper TDD enforcement, and optimal directory structure.

## Tree of Thought Branching

### Branch 1: Aggressive Consolidation
**Approach**: Immediate consolidation, remove all duplicates, keep only best versions
**Pros**: Fast cleanup, minimal confusion, clear structure
**Cons**: Risk of losing valuable content, potential functionality gaps
**Risk Level**: HIGH

### Branch 2: Conservative Migration
**Approach**: Preserve all existing structures, create new alongside
**Pros**: No data loss, safe transition, full rollback capability
**Cons**: Continued complexity, storage overhead, confusion
**Risk Level**: LOW

### Branch 3: Phased Hybrid Approach ⭐ **SELECTED**
**Approach**: Systematic phases with validation gates, preserve-then-archive
**Pros**: Balanced risk, quality control, traceable progress
**Cons**: Longer timeline, more complex process
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM

## Detailed Strategy: Phased Hybrid Approach

### Phase 1: Foundation & Discovery ✅ IN PROGRESS
**Tree Reasoning**: Must understand current state before making changes
- Map all structures and identify source of truth
- Create comprehensive inventories
- Analyze configurations and dependencies
- **Status**: 80% complete (tasks 1-8 done)

### Phase 2: Source of Truth Establishment
**Tree Reasoning**: Single source prevents future confusion
```
Command Sources Analysis:
├── .main/claude_prompt_factory/commands/ (171 files) - CLEANEST
├── tallinn/.claude/commands/ (147 files) - CLAUDE CODE FORMAT  
└── tallinn/claude_prompt_factory/commands/ (191 files) - WORKING COPY

Decision Path:
1. Use .main/ as authoritative source (most complete)
2. Apply tallinn/.claude/ format improvements  
3. Fill gaps from working copy where needed
```

### Phase 3: TDD Framework Design
**Tree Reasoning**: Tests must exist before migration to ensure quality
```
Testing Strategy Tree:
├── Unit Tests (individual command validation)
├── Integration Tests (command interactions)
├── Security Tests (input validation, injection prevention)
└── Performance Tests (loading times, resource usage)

Implementation Order:
1. Framework setup → 2. Template creation → 3. Test generation
```

### Phase 4: Command Migration with TDD
**Tree Reasoning**: Systematic migration with quality gates
```
Migration Priority Matrix:
├── HIGH: Core commands (auto, query, research, task)
├── HIGH: Security commands (secure-audit, secure-scan)
├── HIGH: Testing commands (/test unified, test-e2e)
├── MEDIUM: Development commands (debug, feature, refactor)
└── LOW: Utility/workflow commands

Process: Write Test → Migrate Command → Validate → Security Review
```

### Phase 5: Directory Cleanup Strategy
**Tree Reasoning**: Clean structure after validated migration
```
Cleanup Decision Tree:
├── .main/ → ARCHIVE (preserve as backup)
├── tallinn/claude_prompt_factory/ → ARCHIVE (preserve original)
├── tallinn/.claude/ → MIGRATE to root .claude/
├── tallinn/ docs/reports → CONSOLIDATE (keep essential only)
└── Root .claude/ → POPULATE (final structure)

Archive Strategy:
- Create timestamped archives
- Maintain migration log
- Keep recovery paths open
```

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

### High-Risk Areas Identified:
1. **Command Dependencies**: Some commands may reference others
2. **Configuration Conflicts**: Multiple settings files with different permissions
3. **Test Coverage**: Current 19% coverage insufficient for safe migration
4. **Context Loading**: Import paths may break during restructuring

### Mitigation Approaches:
```
Risk Tree:
├── Command Dependencies
│   └── Solution: Dependency mapping + validation tests
├── Configuration Conflicts  
│   └── Solution: Unified settings.json with proper inheritance
├── Test Coverage
│   └── Solution: Mandatory 80%+ coverage before migration
└── Context Loading
    └── Solution: Update all imports atomically with rollback plan
```

## Tree of Thought Validation

### Decision Point 1: Directory Structure
**Question**: Where should the final commands live?
```
Options Analysis:
├── Root .claude/commands/ ✅
│   └── Pros: Claude Code standard, clean separation
├── tallinn/.claude/commands/
│   └── Cons: Nested structure, not standard
└── Keep multiple directories
    └── Cons: Continued confusion, maintenance overhead

Decision: Root .claude/commands/ (follows Claude Code best practices)
```

### Decision Point 2: Command Format
**Question**: Which format should be the standard?
```
Format Analysis:
├── XML (original) - Complete but non-compliant
├── Simplified Markdown (tallinn/.claude/) - Claude Code native ✅
└── Hybrid - Unnecessary complexity

Decision: Claude Code native format with YAML frontmatter
```

### Decision Point 3: TDD Enforcement Location
**Question**: Where should TDD requirements be enforced?
```
Enforcement Options:
├── CLAUDE.md (master prompt) ✅
├── Individual command templates
├── CI/CD pipeline hooks
└── Documentation only

Decision: CLAUDE.md master prompt + command templates + CI hooks
```

## Implementation Sequence

### Immediate Actions (Next 10 tasks):
1. Complete Phase 1 discovery (tasks 9-14)
2. Design master CLAUDE.md with TDD enforcement (task 24)
3. Create TDD testing framework (task 25)
4. Begin source of truth determination (tasks 16-22)
5. Design migration checklist template (task 34)

### Quality Gates:
- [ ] 80%+ test coverage before any migration
- [ ] Security audit passed for each command
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet targets
- [ ] All imports and dependencies validated

### Success Metrics:
- Single source of truth established
- 50-70 high-quality commands migrated
- Zero broken dependencies
- Clean, compliant Claude Code structure
- Comprehensive documentation

## Conclusion

The **Phased Hybrid Approach** provides the optimal balance of safety, quality, and progress. By using Tree of Thought reasoning, we've identified critical decision points and established clear paths forward with proper risk mitigation.

**Next Step**: Complete Phase 1 discovery tasks and begin Phase 3 TDD framework design.
