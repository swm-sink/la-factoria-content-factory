## Technical Implementation

### Mode-Based Architecture

The unified command uses a sophisticated mode dispatcher that:

- **Validates** command arguments and prerequisites
- **Routes** requests to appropriate mode handlers
- **Integrates** cross-mode functionality seamlessly
- **Manages** state across mode executions
- **Provides** unified monitoring and reporting

### Preserved Functionality

All original functionality has been preserved and enhanced:

```bash
# Legacy command patterns still work through new modes
/workflow start "Development Flow"  ‚Üí /project workflow start "Development Flow"
/env setup production               ‚Üí /project setup production
/auto-provision cloud --enterprise ‚Üí /project provision cloud --scale enterprise
/progress tracker --dashboard      ‚Üí /project track --dashboard
```

### Enhanced Capabilities

The unified approach enables new capabilities:

- **Cross-mode workflows**: Setup ‚Üí Provision ‚Üí Workflow ‚Üí Track
- **Shared state management**: Configuration persists across modes
- **Unified monitoring**: Single dashboard for all project operations
- **Integrated error handling**: Consistent error recovery across modes

## Deprecation Strategy
