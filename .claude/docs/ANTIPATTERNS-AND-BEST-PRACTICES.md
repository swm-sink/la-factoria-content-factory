# Anti-Patterns and Best Practices for Template Customization

This document outlines common mistakes to avoid and proven strategies for successfully customizing the Claude Code Template Library.

## Overview

Template customization is prone to specific anti-patterns that can render commands ineffective or create maintenance burdens. This guide helps you avoid these pitfalls and follow proven best practices.

## Customization Anti-Patterns

### 1. Over-Customization Anti-Pattern

**❌ Anti-Pattern**: Customizing every detail without understanding impact
```markdown
# BAD: Over-customized command that's too specific
/task "implement user authentication with OAuth 2.0 using Auth0 specifically for our enterprise customers who need SAML integration with active directory and custom role mapping for the finance department"
```

**✅ Best Practice**: Keep commands flexible and broadly applicable
```markdown
# GOOD: Appropriately customized command
/task "implement user authentication with OAuth 2.0"
# Let the command handle specifics based on your project configuration
```

**Why This Matters**:
- Over-customized commands become brittle and hard to maintain
- They lose reusability across different project phases
- Team members can't adapt them for their specific needs

### 2. Placeholder Neglect Anti-Pattern

**❌ Anti-Pattern**: Leaving placeholders unreplaced or replacing them inconsistently
```markdown
# BAD: Mixed placeholder replacement
I'll help you implement a specific development task using best practices for React, Node.js, PostgreSQL projects, with appropriate testing and quality standards for your [INSERT_DOMAIN] domain.

I'll follow [INSERT_COMPANY_NAME]'s coding standards...
```

**✅ Best Practice**: Complete and consistent placeholder replacement
```markdown
# GOOD: All placeholders replaced consistently
I'll help you implement a specific development task using best practices for React, Node.js, PostgreSQL projects, with appropriate testing and quality stands for your e-commerce domain.

I'll follow TechCorp's coding standards...
```

**Detection Strategy**:
```bash
# Find all remaining placeholders
grep -r "\[INSERT_" .claude/commands/ | wc -l
# Should return 0 after complete customization
```

### 3. Generic Configuration Anti-Pattern

**❌ Anti-Pattern**: Using one-size-fits-all configurations
```yaml
# BAD: Generic project config
project_config:
  metadata:
    name: "MyProject"
    domain: "software"
  technology:
    stack: "standard web stack"
    testing: "standard testing"
```

**✅ Best Practice**: Specific, actionable configurations
```yaml
# GOOD: Specific project config
project_config:
  metadata:
    name: "EcommerceAPI"
    domain: "e-commerce"
    compliance: ["PCI DSS", "GDPR"]
  technology:
    frontend: "React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS"
    backend: "Node.js 18, Express 4.18, PostgreSQL 14"
    testing: "Jest 29, Cypress 12, Testing Library"
    deployment: "AWS ECS, Docker, GitHub Actions"
```

### 4. Tool Mismatch Anti-Pattern

**❌ Anti-Pattern**: Commands reference tools you don't actually use
```markdown
# BAD: References tools not in your stack
I'll use Maven for dependency management and JUnit 5 for testing...
# (But your project uses npm and Jest)
```

**✅ Best Practice**: Only reference tools you actually use
```markdown
# GOOD: Matches actual tech stack
I'll use npm for dependency management and Jest for testing...
```

**Validation Approach**:
```bash
# Create a tool inventory
echo "Tools mentioned in commands:"
grep -r "Maven\|Gradle\|npm\|yarn" .claude/commands/ | cut -d: -f2 | sort | uniq

echo "Tools actually in project:"
ls package.json pom.xml build.gradle requirements.txt 2>/dev/null
```

### 5. Context Overload Anti-Pattern

**❌ Anti-Pattern**: Including too much context in individual commands
```markdown
# BAD: Command tries to be everything
/task - This command handles development tasks, testing, deployment, monitoring, security audits, code reviews, documentation generation, performance optimization, and team coordination for all types of projects across all domains...
```

**✅ Best Practice**: Focused commands with clear boundaries
```markdown
# GOOD: Focused command with clear purpose
/task - Execute focused development tasks with best practices for EcommerceAPI
```

### 6. Inconsistent Naming Anti-Pattern

**❌ Anti-Pattern**: Inconsistent terminology across commands
```markdown
# Command 1 calls it "e-commerce"
# Command 2 calls it "ecommerce"  
# Command 3 calls it "online retail"
# Command 4 calls it "web commerce"
```

**✅ Best Practice**: Consistent terminology throughout
```markdown
# All commands use "e-commerce" consistently
```

**Consistency Check**:
```bash
# Check for terminology consistency
grep -r "e-commerce\|ecommerce\|online.retail" .claude/commands/ | 
cut -d: -f2 | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
```

### 7. Example Pollution Anti-Pattern

**❌ Anti-Pattern**: Examples that don't match your domain
```markdown
# BAD: E-commerce project with ML examples
/task "train machine learning model for customer churn prediction"
/task "optimize neural network hyperparameters"
# (These don't fit an e-commerce API project)
```

**✅ Best Practice**: Domain-appropriate examples
```markdown
# GOOD: E-commerce appropriate examples
/task "implement shopping cart persistence"
/task "add payment processing validation"
/task "optimize product search indexing"
```

## Best Practices by Category

### 1. Systematic Customization Approach

**Phase 1: Assessment (30 minutes)**
```bash
# Understand current state
/validate-adaptation --verbose
grep -r "\[INSERT_" .claude/commands/ | wc -l

# Inventory your actual tools
ls package.json requirements.txt Gemfile pom.xml 2>/dev/null
git log --oneline -10  # Understand project history
```

**Phase 2: Configuration (45 minutes)**
```bash
# Define project configuration
/adapt-to-project --guided
# Answer questions accurately based on real project state

# Create project-config.yaml with real values
# Test with a few core commands
```

**Phase 3: Implementation (2-4 hours)**
```bash
# Systematic replacement
/replace-placeholders --category=core
# Manual find/replace in editor
# Validate after each category

/validate-adaptation --verbose
# Fix any issues found
```

**Phase 4: Validation (1 hour)**
```bash
# Comprehensive testing
/validate-adaptation --auto-run
# Test key commands manually
# Get team feedback on customized commands
```

### 2. Quality-First Customization

**Start with Quality Standards**:
```yaml
# Define quality gates first
quality_standards:
  test_coverage: 85%  # Your actual requirement
  security_scan: "zero-critical"  # Your actual policy
  performance: "< 200ms"  # Your actual SLA
  code_review: "mandatory"  # Your actual process
```

**Then Customize Commands to Match**:
```markdown
# Quality-aligned customization
I'll ensure 85% test coverage as required by TechCorp quality standards...
I'll follow the mandatory code review process...
I'll validate performance against our < 200ms SLA requirement...
```

### 3. Team-Centric Customization

**Include Team Context**:
```markdown
# Team-aware customization
For our 8-person development team using feature-branch workflow...
I'll create pull request following our team's review guidelines...
I'll coordinate with the QA team for integration testing...
```

**Avoid Over-Personalizing**:
```markdown
# BAD: Too personal
I'll implement this using John's preferred coding style...

# GOOD: Team standard
I'll implement this using TechCorp's coding standards...
```

### 4. Maintenance-Friendly Customization

**Use Configuration-Driven Approach**:
```yaml
# Centralized configuration
project_config:
  team:
    size: 8
    workflow: "feature-branch"
    review_process: "mandatory"
  quality:
    test_coverage: 85
    security_policy: "zero-critical"
```

**Reference Configuration in Commands**:
```markdown
# Commands reference centralized config
I'll follow the {{ team.workflow }} workflow as defined in project configuration...
I'll ensure {{ quality.test_coverage }}% test coverage as required...
```

**Keep Customizations Minimal**:
- Only customize what adds real value
- Prefer configuration over hard-coding
- Document customization decisions

### 5. Validation-Driven Development

**Validate Early and Often**:
```bash
# After each customization phase
/validate-adaptation --category=core
/validate-adaptation --category=development
/validate-adaptation --category=quality
```

**Use Multiple Validation Methods**:
```bash
# Automated validation
/validate-adaptation --auto-run

# Manual testing
# Try commands with real scenarios
/task "implement user authentication"
/api-design "user-profile" "GET"

# Team validation
# Have team members test customized commands
```

## Common Customization Mistakes and Solutions

### Mistake 1: "Set and Forget" Approach

**Problem**: Customizing once and never updating
**Solution**: 
- Schedule quarterly customization reviews
- Update customizations when technology stack changes
- Use `/sync-from-reference` for framework updates

### Mistake 2: "Copy-Paste" Customization

**Problem**: Copying customizations from other projects without adaptation
**Solution**:
- Always run `/adapt-to-project` for each new project
- Validate that copied configurations match your actual setup
- Test customized commands before committing

### Mistake 3: "Perfect First Time" Expectation

**Problem**: Trying to get customization perfect on first attempt
**Solution**:
- Start with minimal customization that works
- Iterate based on team feedback and usage patterns
- Use `/validate-adaptation` to guide improvements

### Mistake 4: "Solo Customization" Approach

**Problem**: One person customizing without team input
**Solution**:
- Include team in customization decisions
- Get feedback on customized commands before finalizing
- Document customization decisions for team understanding
