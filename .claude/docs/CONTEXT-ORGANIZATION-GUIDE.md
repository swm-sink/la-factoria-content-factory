# Context Files Organization and Access Guide

This guide explains the context file system that supports the Claude Code Template Library, how files are organized, and how to access them effectively.

## Context File System Overview

Context files provide background knowledge, patterns, and anti-patterns that inform command behavior. They are located in `.claude/context/` and serve as the knowledge base for template customization and usage.

## Current Context File Organization

## Context File Access Patterns

### For New Users

**Essential Reading Order**:
1. `llm-antipatterns.md` - Understand what NOT to do
2. `prompt-engineering-best-practices.md` - Learn effective patterns
3. `experimental-framework-guide.md` - Understand the system

**Access Method**:
```bash
# Quick overview of anti-patterns
head -50 .claude/context/llm-antipatterns.md

# Search for specific patterns
grep -n "placeholder" .claude/context/prompt-engineering-best-practices.md
```

### For Advanced Customization

**Deep Dive Reading Order**:
1. `modular-components.md` - Understand reusable components
2. `orchestration-patterns.md` - Learn complex workflows
3. `performance-optimization-architecture.md` - Optimize for scale

**Access Method**:
```bash
# Find component examples
grep -A 5 -B 5 "validation-framework" .claude/context/modular-components.md

# Study orchestration patterns
awk '/## Pattern:/{print; getline; print}' .claude/context/orchestration-patterns.md
```

### For Framework Development

**Complete Knowledge Set**:
- All anti-pattern files for mistake prevention
- All architecture files for system understanding
- Quality assessment for current state awareness

**Access Method**:
```bash
# Search across all context files
grep -r "security validation" .claude/context/

# Get file summaries
for file in .claude/context/*.md; do
  echo "=== $file ==="
  head -5 "$file" | tail -3
done
```

## Context File Usage in Commands

### How Commands Reference Context

Commands can reference context files using include patterns:

```markdown
<!-- Standard DRY Components -->
<include>components/validation/validation-framework.md</include>
<include>components/workflow/command-execution.md</include>
<include>components/workflow/error-handling.md</include>
```

### Context Loading Optimization

**Hierarchical Loading**: Context is loaded based on relevance and frequency
```markdown
1. Essential patterns (always loaded)
2. Domain-specific patterns (loaded based on project type)
3. Advanced patterns (loaded on demand)
```

**Memory Management**: Context files are optimized for token efficiency
- Frequently used patterns are prioritized
- Redundant information is minimized
- Context is loaded incrementally based on command complexity

## Optimized Context Access Strategies

### Strategy 1: Progressive Context Loading

**For Basic Usage**:
```bash
# Load essential context only
export CONTEXT_LEVEL="basic"
# References: llm-antipatterns, prompt-engineering-best-practices
```

**For Advanced Usage**:
```bash
# Load comprehensive context
export CONTEXT_LEVEL="advanced"  
# References: All context files with intelligent prioritization
```

### Strategy 2: Domain-Specific Context

**Web Development Focus**:
```bash
# Load web-dev relevant context
export CONTEXT_FOCUS="web-development"
# Emphasizes: performance, security, user experience patterns
```

**Data Science Focus**:
```bash
# Load ML/data relevant context
export CONTEXT_FOCUS="data-science"
# Emphasizes: reproducibility, data quality, model governance patterns
```

### Strategy 3: Task-Specific Context

**Command Development**:
```bash
# Load command creation context
export CONTEXT_TASK="command-development"
# References: modular-components, orchestration-patterns, best-practices
```

**Framework Customization**:
```bash
# Load customization context
export CONTEXT_TASK="customization"
# References: anti-patterns, performance-optimization, quality-assessment
```

## Context File Maintenance

### Regular Updates

**Monthly Review**:
- Assess context file relevance and accuracy
- Update based on user feedback and common issues
- Prune outdated or redundant information

**Quarterly Optimization**:
- Analyze context loading performance
- Reorganize based on usage patterns
- Update documentation cross-references

### Quality Assurance

**Content Validation**:
```bash
# Check for broken references
grep -r "INSERT_" .claude/context/ | grep -v "example"

# Validate markdown syntax
for file in .claude/context/*.md; do
  echo "Checking: $file"
  markdown-lint "$file" || echo "Issues found"
done
```

**Usage Analysis**:
```bash
# Analyze context usage patterns
grep -r "include>" .claude/commands/ | cut -d: -f2 | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr

# Identify unused context files
find .claude/context/ -name "*.md" | while read file; do
  basename="$(basename "$file")"
  if ! grep -r "$basename" .claude/commands/ >/dev/null; then
    echo "Potentially unused: $file"
  fi
done
```

## Context File Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Start with Anti-Patterns**: Always read `llm-antipatterns.md` first
2. **Progressive Learning**: Don't try to absorb all context at once
3. **Task-Focused Reading**: Read context relevant to your current task
4. **Cross-Reference**: Use multiple context files for comprehensive understanding

### For Contributors

1. **Maintain Clarity**: Context files should be clear and actionable
2. **Avoid Redundancy**: Don't duplicate information across files
3. **Update Dependencies**: Keep cross-references current
4. **Validate Examples**: Ensure all examples are tested and accurate

### For Framework Maintainers

1. **Monitor Usage**: Track which context files are most/least used
2. **Performance Optimization**: Ensure context loading doesn't impact command performance
3. **Regular Audits**: Validate context accuracy and relevance
4. **User Feedback Integration**: Update context based on user experience

## Context Search and Discovery

### Finding Relevant Context

**By Topic**:
```bash
# Find security-related context
grep -r -l "security" .claude/context/

# Find performance-related context
grep -r -l "performance\|optimization" .claude/context/
```

**By Pattern Type**:
```bash
# Find anti-patterns
grep -r "❌\|AVOID\|DON'T" .claude/context/

# Find best practices
grep -r "✅\|RECOMMENDED\|BEST" .claude/context/
```

**By Component**:
```bash
# Find validation patterns
grep -r -A 3 -B 3 "validation" .claude/context/modular-components.md

# Find workflow patterns  
grep -r -A 3 -B 3 "workflow" .claude/context/orchestration-patterns.md
```

### Context Quick Reference

**Command to get context overview**:
```bash
# Create context summary
echo "=== CONTEXT FILES SUMMARY ==="
for file in .claude/context/*.md; do
  echo "File: $(basename "$file")"
  echo "Purpose: $(grep -m 1 "^# " "$file" | sed 's/^# //')"
  echo "Size: $(wc -l < "$file") lines"
  echo "---"
done
```

## Integration with Documentation

### Cross-References

Context files are referenced throughout the documentation:

- **Customization Guides**: Reference relevant anti-patterns and best practices
- **API Documentation**: Reference component patterns and orchestration
- **Migration Guides**: Reference historical patterns and lessons learned

### Validation Integration

Context files inform validation processes:

- **Anti-Pattern Detection**: Commands validate against known anti-patterns
- **Best Practice Enforcement**: Customization follows documented best practices
- **Quality Metrics**: Assessment based on context file criteria
