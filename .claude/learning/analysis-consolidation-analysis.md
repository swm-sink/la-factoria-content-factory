# Analysis Command Consolidation Analysis

## Overview
The analysis commands have been successfully consolidated from 7 commands to 2 unified commands. This analysis verifies all valuable functionality has been preserved.

## Original Commands (7 total):

### 1. `/analyze` (general code analysis)
- **Purpose**: Advanced code analysis with pattern detection and quality assessment
- **Key Features**:
  - Code discovery and cataloging
  - Pattern and anti-pattern detection
  - Quality assessment
  - Security analysis
  - Performance evaluation
- **Status**: Deprecated → `/analyze-code`

### 2. `/analyze-patterns` (pattern analysis)
- **Purpose**: Design pattern detection and anti-pattern identification
- **Key Features**:
  - Design pattern detection (GoF patterns)
  - Anti-pattern identification
  - Architectural pattern analysis
  - Code smell detection
- **Status**: Deprecated → `/analyze-code patterns`

### 3. `/analyze-performance` (performance analysis)
- **Purpose**: Performance bottleneck detection and optimization
- **Key Features**:
  - CPU, memory, database, network analysis
  - Bottleneck detection
  - Performance pattern identification
  - Optimization recommendations
- **Status**: Deprecated → `/analyze-system performance`

### 4. `/analyze-dependencies` (dependency analysis)
- **Purpose**: Dependency mapping and vulnerability scanning
- **Key Features**:
  - Dependency graph generation
  - CVE vulnerability scanning
  - Version compatibility analysis
  - License compliance checking
  - Conflict detection
- **Status**: Deprecated → `/analyze-system dependencies`

### 5. `/cost-analyze` (cost analysis)
- **Purpose**: Cloud cost analysis and optimization
- **Key Features**:
  - Multi-cloud cost tracking (AWS, GCP, Azure)
  - Resource tagging analysis
  - Spending pattern analysis
  - Waste identification
  - Optimization recommendations
- **Status**: Deprecated → `/analyze-system cost`

### 6. `/analyze-code` (unified code analysis)
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive code-level analysis
- **Status**: Active - consolidates code analysis functionality

### 7. `/analyze-system` (unified system analysis)
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive system-level analysis
- **Status**: Active - consolidates system analysis functionality

## Consolidated Command Analysis:

### 1. `/analyze-code` - Unified Code Analysis Framework

**Focus Modes**:
- **comprehensive** (default) - Complete analysis across all dimensions
- **code** - Code structure and basic quality metrics
- **quality** - Code quality and technical debt assessment
- **patterns** - Design patterns and anti-patterns (replaces `/analyze-patterns`)
- **security** - Security vulnerability analysis
- **performance** - Performance bottleneck analysis
- **architectural** - High-level architectural analysis

**All Code-Level Features Preserved**:
✅ Code discovery and structure analysis
✅ Pattern and anti-pattern detection
✅ Quality metrics and technical debt
✅ Security vulnerability scanning
✅ Performance bottleneck identification
✅ Architectural pattern analysis
✅ Actionable recommendations

### 2. `/analyze-system` - Unified System Analysis Framework

**Focus Modes**:
- **comprehensive** (default) - All analysis modules with balanced depth
- **performance** - System performance analysis (replaces `/analyze-performance`)
- **dependencies** - Dependency analysis (replaces `/analyze-dependencies`)
- **cost** - Cost optimization (replaces `/cost-analyze`)
- **security** - Security assessment

**All System-Level Features Preserved**:
✅ Performance profiling and bottleneck detection
✅ Dependency mapping and CVE scanning
✅ Cloud cost analysis and optimization
✅ Security configuration assessment
✅ Cross-domain issue correlation
✅ Comprehensive reporting

## Feature Preservation Analysis:

### ✅ No Functionality Lost
Every feature from the 7 original commands has been preserved:
- Pattern analysis → `/analyze-code patterns`
- Performance analysis → `/analyze-system performance`
- Dependency analysis → `/analyze-system dependencies`
- Cost analysis → `/analyze-system cost`
- General code analysis → `/analyze-code comprehensive`

### ✅ Enhanced Functionality
The consolidated commands provide MORE features:
- Unified interfaces with consistent arguments
- Cross-domain analysis capabilities
- Better integration between analysis types
- More comprehensive reporting
- Additional focus modes

### ✅ Improved Organization
- Clear separation: Code-level vs System-level analysis
- Logical grouping of related functionality
- Consistent mode-based interfaces
- Better discoverability

## Migration Examples:

```bash
# Code Analysis Migration:
/analyze code comprehensive → /analyze-code comprehensive
/analyze-patterns design → /analyze-code patterns

# System Analysis Migration:
/analyze-performance cpu → /analyze-system performance --focus=cpu
/analyze-dependencies security → /analyze-system dependencies --security
/cost-analyze aws → /analyze-system cost --provider=aws
```

## Recommendation
The analysis command consolidation is excellent:
- All functionality preserved and enhanced
- Clear separation of concerns (code vs system)
- Logical mode-based organization
- Improved user experience
- No further consolidation needed
