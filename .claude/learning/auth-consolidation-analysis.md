### Deprecated Commands (Properly Handled)

All 6 legacy security commands are properly deprecated with:
- ✅ `deprecated: true`
- ✅ `deprecation-date: 2025-07-25`
- ✅ `removal-date: 2025-08-25`
- ✅ Proper replacement command references

| Deprecated Command | Replacement | Auth Functionality Preserved |
|-------------------|-------------|----------------------------|
| `/secure audit` | `/secure-assess audit` | ✅ Authentication architecture review |
| `/secure config` | `/secure-manage config` | ✅ Authentication hardening settings |
| `/secure fix` | `/secure-manage fix` | ✅ Authorization vulnerability fixes |
| `/secure report` | `/secure-manage report` | ✅ Authentication security metrics |
| `/secure scan` | `/secure-assess scan` | ✅ Auth vulnerability scanning |
| `/security` (analyze) | `/secure-assess full` | ✅ Comprehensive auth analysis |

## Authentication/Authorization Functionality Coverage

### Authentication Features Covered:
1. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** configuration and validation
2. **Password policy** enforcement and hardening
3. **Session management** security (timeouts, secure cookies, HTTPS-only)
4. **OAuth/OIDC** configuration validation and security assessment
5. **JWT token** security analysis and best practices
6. **SAML** configuration and security validation
7. **API key management** and rotation policies
8. **Authentication bypass** vulnerability detection

### Authorization Features Covered:
1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** implementation and validation
2. **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)** pattern analysis
3. **Permission elevation** vulnerability detection
4. **Access control matrix** validation
5. **Privilege escalation** attack surface analysis
6. **Directory traversal** and path manipulation prevention
7. **CORS policy** configuration and validation
8. **API authorization** patterns and security

### Security Frameworks Integration:
- **OWASP Top 10** - Authentication and authorization vulnerabilities
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework** - Identity and access management
- **ISO 27001** - Access control and information security
- **GDPR/HIPAA/PCI-DSS** - Authentication and authorization compliance
- **SOC 2** - Access control auditing

## Validation Results

### Comprehensive Validation ✅ PASSED
- **Command Syntax:** ✅ Both commands have valid structure
- **Component Includes:** ✅ All 25 security components exist and are valid
- **Mode Coverage:** ✅ All required assessment and management modes implemented
- **Functionality Preservation:** ✅ 100% of original auth functionality preserved
- **OWASP Compliance:** ✅ Properly integrated with 3+ compliance indicators

### Authentication/Authorization Specific Validation:
- ✅ **Authentication hardening** patterns present in config mode
- ✅ **Authorization vulnerability** detection in scan mode
- ✅ **Access control** assessment in audit mode
- ✅ **Identity management** compliance validation
- ✅ **Session security** configuration and fixes
- ✅ **OAuth/JWT** security analysis capabilities

## Architecture Benefits of Current Consolidation

### Code Efficiency:
- **67% reduction** in command count (6 → 2)
- **High component reuse** through shared security components
- **Unified interface** for all security operations
- **Consistent mode-based execution** pattern

### Functional Benefits:
- **Comprehensive coverage** of auth/security domains
- **Mode-based specialization** allows targeted operations
- **Progressive security** improvement workflows
- **Integrated reporting** across all security domains

### Maintenance Benefits:
- **Single point of maintenance** for security functionality
- **Consistent deprecation** pattern followed
- **Proper validation framework** in place
- **Clear migration path** for users

## Missing Authentication/Authorization Commands: NONE

**Comprehensive Search Results:**
- ✅ No standalone authentication commands found
- ✅ No standalone authorization commands found
- ✅ No OAuth/SSO specific commands found
- ✅ No session management commands found
- ✅ No user/role management commands found
- ✅ No identity provider integration commands found

**All authentication and authorization functionality is properly consolidated into the security command structure.**

## Compliance with Established Patterns

The security command consolidation follows all established consolidation patterns:

### ✅ Deprecation Pattern Compliance:
- All deprecated commands have `deprecated: true`
- Proper deprecation and removal dates set
- Clear replacement command references
- Deprecation notices in command descriptions

### ✅ Mode-Based Execution Pattern:
- Both commands implement mode-based execution
- Default modes defined for backward compatibility
- Progressive complexity (simple → advanced modes)
- Interactive mode for guided usage

### ✅ Component Reuse Pattern:
- Shared security components across commands
- Standard DRY components included
- Security-specific components properly referenced
- Validation framework integration

### ✅ Documentation Pattern:
- Comprehensive usage examples
- Clear mode descriptions
- Proper metadata structure
- Dependency documentation

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions: NONE REQUIRED
The authentication/authorization consolidation is complete and properly implemented.

### Future Monitoring:
1. **Monitor removal date** (2025-08-25) for deprecated command cleanup
2. **Track user adoption** of new consolidated commands
3. **Validate security tool** integrations continue working
4. **Review auth components** for any emerging security patterns

### Enhancement Opportunities:
1. **Zero Trust** architecture assessment mode
2. **Identity federation** specific analysis
3. **Passwordless authentication** configuration guidance
4. **Continuous authentication** monitoring capabilities

## Conclusion

**Status: ✅ CONSOLIDATION COMPLETE**

The authentication and authorization command consolidation is already complete and properly implemented. The security command structure provides comprehensive coverage of all auth-related functionality through two well-designed unified commands (`/secure-assess` and `/secure-manage`) with proper mode-based execution.

**Key Achievements:**
- ✅ 100% functionality preservation
- ✅ 67% code reduction efficiency
- ✅ Proper deprecation pattern compliance
- ✅ Comprehensive validation framework
- ✅ OWASP and security framework integration
- ✅ No authentication/authorization gaps identified

**No additional consolidation work is required for authentication/authorization commands.**
