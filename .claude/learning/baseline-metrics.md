# Baseline Metrics - Pre-Transformation

**Date**: 2025-07-25
**Phase**: Pre-transformation baseline documentation

## Current System Metrics

### Structure Metrics
- **Total Commands**: 67 files (.claude/commands/)
- **Total Components**: 63 files (.claude/components/)
- **Component Directories**: 30 (23 with content, 7 empty)
- **Context Files**: 7 files (.claude/context/)
- **Total MD Files**: 148 active files

### Quality Metrics
- **Test Coverage**: 0% (no tests implemented)
- **Command Organization**: Flat structure (all 67 in single directory)
- **Broken References**: Unknown (not yet scanned)
- **Documentation Files**: 34+ scattered READMEs

### Component Distribution
- Optimization: 7 files
- Context: 7 files  
- Orchestration: 7 files
- Constitutional: 5 files
- Reasoning: 4 files
- Workflow: 4 files
- Quality: 3 files
- Testing: 3 files
- Other categories: 2 or fewer files each

### Known Issues
1. **Cognitive Overload**: 67 flat commands with similar names
2. **Zero Implementation**: No actual working examples
3. **Complex Structure**: Over-engineered without execution
4. **Documentation Explosion**: 34+ README files scattered
5. **Unclear Boundaries**: Overlapping command functionality

### Transformation Targets
- Commands: 67 → 40 (40% reduction)
- Components: 63 → 35 (44% reduction)
- Test Coverage: 0% → 60%
- Documentation: 34 files → 3 core files
- Max Directory Depth: Flat → Hierarchical (3 levels)

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Commands reduced to 40 or fewer
- [ ] Components reduced to 35 or fewer
- [ ] Test coverage at 60% minimum
- [ ] Documentation consolidated to 3 files
- [ ] All broken references fixed
- [ ] Working examples for each command
- [ ] Anti-pattern prevention integrated
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established
