# Security Command Consolidation Analysis

## Overview
The security commands have already been consolidated from 6 commands to 2 unified commands. This analysis ensures no valuable functionality was lost.

## Original Commands (6 total):

### 1. `/security` (general security analysis)
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive security analysis based on OWASP standards
- **Key Features**: 
  - Vulnerability scanning (OWASP Top 10)
  - Security pattern analysis
  - Prioritized vulnerability report
- **Status**: Deprecated → `/secure-assess full`

### 2. `/secure-scan` (automated scanning)
- **Purpose**: High-performance security scanner with multiple engines
- **Key Features**:
  - Vulnerability scanning
  - Dependency scanning  
  - Static code analysis
  - Secret detection
  - JSON output format
- **Status**: Deprecated → `/secure-assess scan`

### 3. `/secure-audit` (deep audit)
- **Purpose**: Advanced security audit with threat modeling
- **Key Features**:
  - Comprehensive vulnerability assessment
  - Compliance validation
  - Threat modeling
  - Penetration testing
  - OWASP-focused audits
- **Status**: Deprecated → `/secure-assess audit`

### 4. `/secure-fix` (remediation)
- **Purpose**: Automated security issue remediation
- **Key Features**:
  - Vulnerability fixes
  - Permission fixes
  - Dependency updates
  - Validation and rollback
  - Test coverage verification
- **Status**: Deprecated → `/secure-manage fix`

### 5. `/secure-config` (configuration)
- **Purpose**: Security configuration validation and hardening
- **Key Features**:
  - Environment-specific hardening
  - Compliance configuration (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS)
  - Authentication hardening
  - Security headers
  - Encryption settings
- **Status**: Deprecated → `/secure-manage config`

### 6. `/secure-report` (reporting)
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive security reporting
- **Key Features**:
  - Compliance status reports
  - Vulnerability assessment reports
  - Executive summaries
  - Trends and metrics
  - PDF output format
- **Status**: Deprecated → `/secure-manage report`

## Consolidated Commands (2 total):

### 1. `/secure-assess` (Assessment & Analysis)
**Consolidates**: `/security`, `/secure-scan`, `/secure-audit`

**Modes**:
- `full` - Comprehensive assessment (replaces `/security`)
- `scan` - Quick vulnerability scan (replaces `/secure-scan`)
- `audit` - Deep security audit (replaces `/secure-audit`)
- `compliance` - Compliance validation
- `threats` - Threat modeling

**All Original Features Preserved**:
✅ Vulnerability scanning (OWASP Top 10)
✅ Dependency scanning
✅ Static code analysis
✅ Secret detection
✅ Security pattern analysis
✅ Threat modeling
✅ Penetration testing
✅ Compliance validation
✅ Multiple output formats (JSON, structured)

### 2. `/secure-manage` (Management & Operations)
**Consolidates**: `/secure-fix`, `/secure-config`, `/secure-report`

**Modes**:
- `config` - Security configuration (replaces `/secure-config`)
- `fix` - Vulnerability remediation (replaces `/secure-fix`)
- `report` - Security reporting (replaces `/secure-report`)
- `harden` - Combined config + fix
- `interactive` - Guided mode selection

**All Original Features Preserved**:
✅ Automated vulnerability fixes
✅ Permission and access control fixes
✅ Safe dependency updates
✅ Validation and rollback capabilities
✅ Environment-specific hardening
✅ Compliance configuration (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS)
✅ Security headers configuration
✅ Comprehensive reporting with trends
✅ Executive summaries
✅ Multiple output formats (PDF, JSON)

## Analysis Results

### ✅ No Functionality Lost
All features from the 6 original commands have been preserved in the 2 consolidated commands.

### ✅ Enhanced Functionality
The consolidated commands actually provide MORE functionality:
- Better mode-based organization
- Unified interfaces
- Additional modes (interactive, harden, threats)
- More comprehensive coverage

### ✅ Improved User Experience
- Clearer command structure
- Reduced command count (6 → 2)
- Logical grouping (assessment vs management)
- Consistent argument patterns

## Recommendation
The security consolidation was well-executed. All valuable prompts and functionality have been preserved and enhanced. No further action needed for security commands.

## Next Steps
Move on to analyze the next consolidation target: Pipeline commands.
