## Learning Objectives

By the end of this study guide, students will be able to:

1. **Understand** the fundamental concepts of Python programming
2. **Apply** basic Python syntax to solve simple problems
3. **Analyze** code structure and identify common patterns
4. **Create** simple Python programs using variables, functions, and control structures

## Key Concepts

### 1. Variables and Data Types

**Definition**: Variables are containers for storing data values in Python.

**Core Data Types**:
- `int` - Integer numbers (e.g., 42, -17)
- `float` - Decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14, -2.5)
- `str` - Text strings (e.g., "Hello World")
- `bool` - True/False values

**Example**:
```python
# Variable assignment
name = "Alice"           # String
age = 16                # Integer
grade_average = 87.5    # Float
is_student = True       # Boolean
```

### 2. Functions

**Definition**: Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks.

**Structure**:
```python
def function_name(parameters):
    # Function body
    return result
```

**Example**:
```python
def calculate_grade(points, total):
    percentage = (points / total) * 100
    return percentage

# Using the function
my_grade = calculate_grade(85, 100)
print(f"My grade is: {my_grade}%")
```

### 3. Control Structures

#### Conditional Statements (if/elif/else)
```python
grade = 85

if grade >= 90:
    letter_grade = "A"
elif grade >= 80:
    letter_grade = "B"
elif grade >= 70:
    letter_grade = "C"
else:
    letter_grade = "F"
```

#### Loops
```python
# For loop - repeat a specific number of times
for i in range(5):
    print(f"Count: {i}")

# While loop - repeat while condition is true
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(f"Count: {count}")
    count += 1
```

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Variable Practice
Create variables for:
- Your name (string)
- Your favorite number (integer)
- Your height in feet (float)
- Whether you like programming (boolean)

### Exercise 2: Function Creation
Write a function called `area_rectangle` that:
- Takes two parameters: length and width
- Calculates the area (length Ã— width)
- Returns the result

### Exercise 3: Control Flow
Write a program that:
- Asks the user for a number
- Checks if the number is positive, negative, or zero
- Prints an appropriate message

## Study Tips

1. **Practice Daily**: Write small programs every day
2. **Read Code**: Study examples and try to understand how they work
3. **Experiment**: Modify existing code to see what happens
4. **Debug**: Learn to read and fix error messages
5. **Build Projects**: Apply concepts to create something useful

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Indentation Errors**: Python uses indentation to group code
2. **Missing Colons**: Remember colons after if, for, while, and def statements
3. **Case Sensitivity**: Python distinguishes between uppercase and lowercase
4. **Undefined Variables**: Make sure to assign values before using variables

## Assessment Questions

### Multiple Choice
1. Which data type would you use to store a person's age?
   a) str  b) int  c) float  d) bool

2. What symbol is used to assign a value to a variable?
   a) ==  b) =  c) !=  d) <>

### Short Answer
3. Explain the difference between a parameter and an argument in functions.

4. When would you use a while loop instead of a for loop?

### Coding Problems
5. Write a function that converts Fahrenheit to Celsius.

6. Create a program that prints all even numbers from 1 to 20.
