## Implementation Guidelines

### Technical Architecture

#### API Endpoint Design
```python
@app.post("/api/v1/generate", response_model=ContentResponse)
async def generate_content(
    request: ContentRequest,
    api_key: str = Depends(verify_api_key)
) -> ContentResponse:
    """
    Generate educational content using AI models
    
    Returns:
        ContentResponse with generated content and quality metrics
    """
```

#### Content Generation Service
```python
class EducationalContentService:
    async def generate_content(self, request: ContentRequest) -> ContentResponse:
        # 1. Load prompt template
        template = await self.prompt_loader.load_template(request.content_type)
        
        # 2. Format prompt with parameters
        prompt = self.format_prompt(template, request)
        
        # 3. Generate content using AI provider
        content = await self.ai_service.generate(prompt, request)
        
        # 4. Assess content quality
        quality_score = await self.quality_service.assess(content, request)
        
        # 5. Validate quality thresholds
        if quality_score.overall < 0.70:
            # Regenerate up to 3 times
            return await self.regenerate_content(request, attempt + 1)
        
        # 6. Return structured response
        return ContentResponse(content=content, quality_score=quality_score)
```

#### Quality Assessment Framework
```python
class EducationalQualityAssessment:
    async def assess_content(self, content: str, request: ContentRequest) -> QualityScore:
        return QualityScore(
            educational_value=await self.assess_educational_value(content, request),
            factual_accuracy=await self.assess_factual_accuracy(content),
            age_appropriateness=await self.assess_age_appropriateness(content, request),
            structural_quality=await self.assess_structure(content),
            engagement_level=await self.assess_engagement(content),
            overall=self.calculate_overall_score()
        )
```
