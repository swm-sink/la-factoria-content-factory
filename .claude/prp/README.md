# Product Requirements Prompts (PRP) - La Factoria

**Framework Origin**: Based on Rasmus Widing's foundational work in agentic engineering (Summer 2024)

## üéØ PRP Framework Overview

The Product Requirements Prompt (PRP) methodology provides structured context engineering for AI-assisted development. This framework transforms development from reactive prompt engineering to proactive context management.

### Core PRP Principles
1. **Comprehensive Initial Context**: Detailed feature requirements before implementation
2. **Structured Documentation**: Standardized format for consistent AI understanding
3. **Validation-Driven Development**: Built-in quality gates and success criteria
4. **Iterative Refinement**: Continuous improvement through feedback loops

- Technical feasibility and architecture considerations

### 2. PRP Creation
- Structured documentation using standard template
- Cross-reference with related PRPs and components
- Validation against project architecture and standards

### 3. Implementation Planning
- Break down into development tasks
- Define quality gates and acceptance criteria
- Plan testing and validation approach

### 4. Development Execution
- Use PRP as definitive reference for implementation
- Regular validation against PRP requirements
- Update PRP based on implementation learnings

### 5. Validation and Refinement
- Test against PRP success criteria
- Gather feedback and usage data
- Iterate and improve PRP for future development

## üéì Educational Content Focus

### PRP Educational Standards
All PRPs must address educational requirements:

- **Pedagogical Effectiveness**: Learning science integration
- **Age Appropriateness**: Target audience alignment
- **Quality Thresholds**: Minimum quality requirements (‚â•0.70 overall)
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance and inclusive design
- **Content Safety**: Appropriate and safe educational content

### Quality Assessment Integration
PRPs include built-in quality assessment:

- **Educational Value**: Measurable learning outcomes (‚â•0.75)
- **Factual Accuracy**: Information reliability verification (‚â•0.85)
- **Engagement**: User experience and interaction quality
- **Compliance**: Educational standards and regulatory adherence

## üîó Integration with Context System

### Cross-Reference Architecture
PRPs integrate with the broader context system:

- **Examples Directory**: Working implementations of PRP requirements
- **Domain Organization**: PRPs organized by educational, technical, AI, and operations domains
- **Architecture Overview**: PRPs align with overall system architecture
- **Memory System**: PRP decisions documented in project memory

### Living Documentation
PRPs serve as living documentation:

- **Real-time Updates**: PRPs updated based on implementation feedback
- **Version Control**: Track PRP evolution and decision rationale
- **Cross-Validation**: Ensure PRP consistency across project components
- **AI Context**: Provide comprehensive context for AI-assisted development

## üìä PRP Success Metrics
