interface AppState {
  currentContent: GeneratedContent | null;
  contentLibrary: GeneratedContent[];
  generationState: {
    isLoading: boolean;
    progress: number;
    currentStep: GenerationStep;
  };
  qualityAssessment: {
    scores: QualityScores | null;
    feedback: QualityFeedback[];
    improvementSuggestions: string[];
  };
  userPreferences: {
    defaultLanguage: string;
    preferredContentTypes: ContentType[];
    accessibilitySettings: AccessibilityOptions;
  };
}

// Educational domain-specific hooks
const useContentGeneration = () => {
  // Handles content generation workflow
  // Integrates with PRP-002 backend API
  // Manages quality assessment integration
};

const useEducationalValidation = () => {
  // Validates educational content inputs
  // Ensures age-appropriateness compliance
  // Provides pedagogical guidance
};
```

#### Integration with PRP-002 Backend
```typescript
// Type-safe API integration with backend
interface ContentApiClient {
  generateContent(request: ContentRequest): Promise<ContentResponse>;
  getContentTypes(): Promise<ContentType[]>;
  getContent(id: string): Promise<GeneratedContent>;
  exportContent(id: string, format: ExportFormat): Promise<Blob>;
}

// Error handling for educational context
interface EducationalError {
  type: 'validation' | 'generation' | 'quality' | 'network';
  message: string;
  educationalGuidance?: string;
  suggestedActions: string[];
}
```
