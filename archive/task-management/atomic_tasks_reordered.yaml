  title: "AI-Inferred: Initial .gitignore and .dockerignore Setup"
  files: [".gitignore", ".dockerignore"]
  depends: []
  done_when: ".gitignore and .dockerignore files are created at the project root with standard exclusions for Python (e.g., __pycache__, .venv, .env) and Docker (e.g., .git, .vscode, Dockerfile itself in .dockerignore if not needed in context)."
  status: done
  ai_ref: "AI-InferredTask-20240531"
  completion_notes: "This task was inferred by the AI assistant (Gemini) as likely completed foundational work. It represents the creation of standard .gitignore and .dockerignore files."
  meta_task: "META-INFERRED-FOUNDATION"

- id: INFERRED-LOGGING-001
  objective: "Establish a basic structured logging configuration for the application using Python's logging module, adhering to project standards."
  title: "AI-Inferred: Core Logging Configuration Setup"
  files: ["app/main.py"]
  depends: ["INFERRED-FASTAPI-001"]
  done_when: "Basic logging is configured in the application, setting a default log level and format. Logs are output to the console."
  status: done
  ai_ref: "AI-InferredTask-20240531"
  completion_notes: "This task was inferred by the AI assistant (Gemini) as likely completed foundational work. It represents the initial setup of the Python logging module as per project rules (Section C.1)."
  meta_task: "META-INFERRED-FOUNDATION"

- id: INFERRED-ERRORHANDLING-001
  objective: "Implement a basic framework for custom error handling in the FastAPI application, including base exception classes and handlers to return structured error responses."
  title: "AI-Inferred: Basic Error Handling Framework Setup"
  files: ["app/core/exceptions.py", "app/main.py"]
  depends: ["INFERRED-FASTAPI-001"]
  done_when: "Base custom exception classes are defined. FastAPI application has handlers for these custom exceptions and potentially for generic HTTPExceptions, returning responses aligned with Rule H."
  status: done
  ai_ref: "AI-InferredTask-20240531"
  completion_notes: "This task was inferred by the AI assistant (Gemini) as likely completed foundational work. It represents the initial setup of custom exception classes and FastAPI exception handlers as per project Rule H."
  meta_task: "META-INFERRED-FOUNDATION"

- id: INFERRED-PYDANTIC-001
  objective: "Adopt Pydantic for data validation and serialization by creating initial basic Pydantic models for early API request/response schemas."
