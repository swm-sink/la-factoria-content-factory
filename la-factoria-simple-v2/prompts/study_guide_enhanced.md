## JSON STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:

Your output MUST be a valid JSON object that strictly adheres to the StudyGuide schema:

```json
{
  "title": "Clear, Descriptive Study Guide Title",
  "overview": "Comprehensive overview that sets expectations and motivates learning (300-800 chars)",
  "key_concepts": [
    "Concept 1: Core principle or term",
    "Concept 2: Important methodology",
    "Concept 3: Key framework",
    "Concept 4: Essential skill",
    "Concept 5: Fundamental theory",
    "(Include 5-20 concepts total)"
  ],
  "detailed_content": "Main study content organized by sections...",
  "summary": "Concise recap emphasizing key takeaways (300-800 chars)",
  "recommended_reading": [
    "Resource 1: Brief description",
    "Resource 2: Brief description"
  ]
}
```

### Detailed Content Guidelines:
The `detailed_content` field should be structured as follows:
- Start with an engaging introduction
- Organize content by the outline's main sections
- For each section:
  * Begin with learning objectives
  * Present core information clearly
  * Include examples and applications
  * End with key points to remember
- Conclude with synthesis and next steps

### Length Requirements:
- `title`: 10-200 characters (match outline title when appropriate)
- `overview`: 300-800 characters (expanded from original 100-1000)
- `key_concepts`: 5-20 items, each 10-100 characters
- `detailed_content`: 2000-8000 characters (expanded minimum from 500)
- `summary`: 300-800 characters (expanded from original 100-1000)
- `recommended_reading`: 0-5 items (optional)

## CONTENT GENERATION RULES:

1. **Accuracy**: Ensure all information is factually correct and up-to-date
2. **Relevance**: Every element must serve the learning objectives
3. **Balance**: Mix theory with practical application
4. **Accessibility**: Write for comprehension, not to impress
5. **Engagement**: Make the content interesting and memorable

## COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID:

- ❌ Generic filler content or vague statements
- ❌ Overly complex language without explanation
- ❌ Jumping between topics without transitions
- ❌ Inconsistent depth across sections
- ❌ Missing practical examples or applications
- ❌ Including off-topic information

## IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:

1. Generate ONLY valid JSON without any markdown formatting or surrounding text
2. Do NOT include any PII (names, addresses, emails, phone numbers)
3. Ensure all content is educational and appropriate
4. Maintain academic integrity and cite general sources where relevant
5. Focus on teaching for understanding, not rote memorization

## ERROR PREVENTION:

- Double-check all JSON syntax (proper quotes, commas, brackets)
- Verify all text is properly escaped for JSON
- Ensure character counts are within specified ranges
- Confirm all required fields are present
- Validate that content aligns with the outline structure
