# Error Analysis Report

This document provides a simplified analysis of common errors found during testing, potential root causes, and suggested actions.

**Error Analysis Period:** MVP Development & Pre-Deployment Testing (Up to 2025-05-30)

**Overall Error Landscape:** During the MVP development, errors were primarily caught and addressed during unit testing, integration testing, and iterative development. No persistent, critical runtime errors have been observed in the latest stable build used for E2E testing.

**Common Categories of Errors Encountered (and Resolved) During Development:**

1.  **Type Errors (Python Backend & TypeScript Frontend):**
    *   **Description:** Mismatches between expected and actual data types, often caught by MyPy (Python) and TypeScript compiler (Frontend).
    *   **Frequency:** Moderate during early development, significantly reduced with Pydantic model enforcement and stricter TypeScript typing.
    *   **Root Causes (Examples):**
        *   Incorrectly assuming AI output structure before Pydantic validation.
        *   Frontend state not correctly typed to match API responses.
        *   Missing or incorrect type hints.
    *   **Resolution Actions Taken:**
        *   Rigorous use of Pydantic models for all API request/response cycles and for parsing AI outputs.
        *   Comprehensive TypeScript types/interfaces for frontend state and API interactions (`frontend/src/types/`).
        *   Regular static analysis runs (`mypy`, `tsc`).

2.  **API Contract Mismatches (Frontend-Backend Integration):**
    *   **Description:** Discrepancies between frontend API calls (payload, path, method) and backend endpoint expectations.
    *   **Frequency:** Occasional, especially when new endpoints were introduced or modified.
    *   **Root Causes (Examples):**
        *   Frontend sending data in a slightly different structure than backend Pydantic model expected.
        *   Incorrect API endpoint paths called from frontend.
        *   HTTP method mismatches (e.g., GET vs. POST).
    *   **Resolution Actions Taken:**
        *   Clear API documentation (initially via FastAPI's auto-docs, then potentially refined).
        *   Shared understanding of Pydantic models as the source of truth for API contracts.
        *   Iterative testing during frontend component development that interacts with new backend endpoints.

3.  **Configuration & Environment Errors:**
    *   **Description:** Issues related to missing environment variables, incorrect secret configurations, or misconfigured service connections.
    *   **Frequency:** Low, primarily during initial setup of new services (e.g., Firestore, Cloud Tasks).
    *   **Root Causes (Examples):**
        *   `.env` file not correctly populated for local development.
        *   Incorrect IAM permissions for service accounts in GCP.
        *   Typos in environment variable names referenced in `settings.py`.
    *   **Resolution Actions Taken:**
        *   Clear `.env.example` file.
        *   Systematic loading of settings via `app/core/config/settings.py` and secrets via `app/core/security/secrets.py`.
        *   Terraform for managing GCP resource configurations and IAM.

4.  **AI Output Parsing/Validation Failures:**
    *   **Description:** The AI model (Gemini) occasionally returns output that doesn't perfectly match the expected JSON structure, or violates content constraints (e.g., length), leading to Pydantic validation errors.
    *   **Frequency:** Moderate, especially during initial prompt engineering for new content types.
    *   **Root Causes (Examples):**
        *   Ambiguous instructions in AI prompts.
        *   The AI occasionally being too creative or verbose, breaking structural requirements.
        *   Unexpected characters or formatting in AI output that breaks JSON parsing.
    *   **Resolution Actions Taken:**
        *   Iterative refinement of AI prompts to be more explicit about desired JSON structure and content constraints (Rule J.5.e).
        *   Robust error handling in the backend worker (`app/api/routes/worker.py`) to catch Pydantic `ValidationError` when parsing AI output, logging the error, and marking the job as FAILED gracefully.
        *   Prompts explicitly request JSON output.

**Actionable Next Steps for Ongoing Improvement:**
*   **Continue to emphasize strong typing** in both backend and frontend to catch errors early.
*   **Maintain thorough unit and integration tests**, especially for API contract adherence and AI output validation logic.
*   **Review logs regularly** (especially from the worker processing AI output) for any recurring validation errors from the AI, which might indicate a need for further prompt tuning.
*   **Consider adding automated API contract testing** (e.g., using a tool that consumes OpenAPI spec) to CI/CD pipeline if project complexity grows significantly.
