## üîß Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

#### 1. 502 Bad Gateway
**Symptoms:** Application not responding
**Investigation:**
```bash
railway logs --tail 100
```
**Common Causes:**
- Environment variables missing
- Database connection failure
- Application startup errors
- Memory/CPU exhaustion

**Resolution:**
1. Check environment variables in Railway dashboard
2. Verify DATABASE_URL is set
3. Check AI provider API keys
4. Review application logs for specific errors

#### 2. Database Connection Errors
**Symptoms:** Database health check failing
**Investigation:**
```bash
railway connect
\dt  # List tables
```
**Resolution:**
1. Verify DATABASE_URL environment variable
2. Check Railway PostgreSQL service status
3. Run database migration if needed:
```bash
railway run psql -d $DATABASE_URL -f migrations/001_initial_schema.sql
```

#### 3. AI Provider Errors
**Symptoms:** Content generation failures
**Investigation:**
- Check `/api/v1/health/detailed` for AI provider status
- Review logs for API key errors
- Verify rate limits not exceeded

**Resolution:**
1. Verify AI provider API keys in Railway dashboard
2. Check provider status pages
3. Implement provider failover if needed

#### 4. Quality Assessment Failures
**Symptoms:** Quality scores consistently low or errors
**Investigation:**
- Check educational metrics endpoint
- Review content generation logs
- Verify quality thresholds configuration

**Resolution:**
1. Review quality assessment configuration
2. Check for prompt template issues
3. Validate content complexity against audience

#### 5. Performance Degradation
**Symptoms:** Slow response times
**Investigation:**
- Monitor system metrics endpoint
- Check database query performance
- Review resource utilization

**Resolution:**
1. Scale resources if needed
2. Optimize database queries
3. Implement caching where appropriate
4. Review AI provider response times

### Common Database Operations

#### Check System Health
```sql
-- Total content generated
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_content FROM educational_content;

-- Recent activity (last 24 hours)
SELECT COUNT(*) as recent_content 
FROM educational_content 
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';

-- Quality metrics
SELECT 
    AVG(quality_score) as avg_quality,
    AVG(educational_effectiveness) as avg_educational,
    AVG(factual_accuracy) as avg_accuracy
FROM educational_content 
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days';
```

#### Content Type Analysis
```sql
SELECT 
    content_type,
    COUNT(*) as count,
    AVG(quality_score) as avg_quality
FROM educational_content 
GROUP BY content_type 
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

#### Performance Analysis
```sql
SELECT 
    content_type,
    AVG(generation_duration_ms) as avg_duration,
    MIN(generation_duration_ms) as min_duration,
    MAX(generation_duration_ms) as max_duration
FROM educational_content 
WHERE generation_duration_ms IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY content_type;
```
