**Generated**: 2025-06-02 20:54:42

## üìä Current Cycle Analysis

### What Was Accomplished

‚úÖ **1 commits** in the last 24 hours
üìà **Activity Level**: MEDIUM

**Recent Changes**:
- 677ec66 Phase 0: Cursor pre-flight bootstrap

üö® **Infrastructure Status**: Critical issues remain
‚ö†Ô∏è  Feature development blocked until infrastructure is fixed

üîß **Maintenance Needed**: 2 file issues, 17 TODOs

## üéØ Next Cycle Recommendations

**Choose Your Path**: Select the option that aligns with your goals and available time:

### Option 1: Complete Infrastructure Setup (CRITICAL Priority) üö® **BLOCKS OTHER WORK**
**Category**: Infrastructure
**Estimated Time**: 30-60 minutes
**Description**: Critical infrastructure issues prevent feature development

**Decision Point**: Should I focus on fixing infrastructure first?

**If you choose this path:**
1. Run fix commands from issue_analysis.md
1. Test database connectivity
1. Verify API endpoints work
1. Confirm authentication setup

**Success Criteria**: API endpoints respond without infrastructure errors

### Option 2: Address Project Maintenance (MEDIUM Priority)
**Category**: Maintenance
**Estimated Time**: 30-90 minutes
**Description**: Found file consistency issues and 17 TODOs

**Decision Point**: Should I clean up project maintenance items?

**If you choose this path:**
1. Create missing project files (e.g., CHANGELOG.md)
1. Review and address TODO comments
1. Update stale documentation
1. Run tests and fix any failures

**Success Criteria**: All project files up-to-date, reduced TODO count

## ü§î Decision Framework

**To help you decide, consider:**

- **Time Available**: How much time do you have for this cycle?
- **Energy Level**: Are you in a building mood or a fixing mood?
- **Project Goals**: What outcome would provide the most value?
- **Blocking Issues**: Are there any critical blockers that must be addressed first?

**Recommended Approach**:
üö® **Address blocking issues first** - Option 1 prevents progress on other work
‚è±Ô∏è  **Quick wins** - Fix blockers now, then choose development path

## üîÑ Ready-to-Use Workflow

**Once you've decided on your path:**

1. **Copy the appropriate prompt** from `next_cycle_instructions.md`
2. **Include this transition report** for context about what was just completed
3. **Use the relevant context files**:
   - `complete_codebase.md` for technical details
   - `issue_analysis.md` for current blockers
   - `quick_reference.md` for API information

## ‚ö° Quick Actions

**If you want to start immediately:**

**For Complete Infrastructure Setup:**
```bash
# 1. Update your context
python scripts/smart_ai_context.py

# 2. Use this prompt with your AI assistant:
# Use 'Critical Issue Resolution Prompt' from next_cycle_instructions.md
```
