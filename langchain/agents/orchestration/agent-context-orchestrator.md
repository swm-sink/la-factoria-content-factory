### Context Enhancement Workflows

#### Adaptive Context Evolution
```bash
# Context adaptation to project evolution
@context-orchestrator "Monitor project changes and adapt context accordingly"

# Weekly context evolution check
git log --since="1 week ago" --name-only | grep -E "\.(py|md)$" | sort | uniq
# Identify new patterns requiring context updates
# Update relevant domain and agent contexts
# Validate context alignment with current project state
```

#### Context Quality Maintenance
```bash
# Ongoing context quality assurance
find .claude/ -name "*.md" -exec grep -l "TODO\|FIXME\|OUTDATED" {} \;
# Regular context freshness assessment
# Automated cross-reference validation
# Context effectiveness metrics monitoring
```

### Integration Patterns

#### Context-Agent Coordination
```bash
# Context enhancement workflow integration
@context-explorer → detailed context analysis
↓ (findings inform planning)
@context-planner → optimal context architecture design
↓ (plan guides implementation)
@context-implementer → systematic context improvements
↓ (implementation validated)
@context-validator → effectiveness verification and metrics
```

#### Development Workflow Integration
```bash
# Context supporting development workflows
New Feature Development → context/requirements/ → agents/dev-planner.md → implementation
Code Quality Issues → agents/cleanup-orchestrator.md → context/quality/ → remediation
Educational Content → domains/educational/ → agents/content/ → generation and validation
```
