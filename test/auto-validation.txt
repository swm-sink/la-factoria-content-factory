# Automated Validation Outputs

This file is intended to store more raw, but still somewhat readable, outputs from automated checks and validation scripts.

Examples might include:
- Detailed output from specific linting or static analysis runs (if not fully captured elsewhere).
- Results from automated API contract tests.
- Outputs from specific data validation scripts.
