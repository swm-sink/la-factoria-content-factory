2. The conversational tone and pacing for audio learning
3. Where to place key information for maximum retention
4. How to use stories and examples to illustrate concepts
5. Natural transition points between segments
6. How to reinforce learning without visual aids
</thinking>

<instructions>
Create a comprehensive podcast script that transforms educational content into an engaging audio experience.

<success_criteria>
- Opening hook captures attention within 15 seconds
