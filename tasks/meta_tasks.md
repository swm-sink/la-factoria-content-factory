  - [x] Application Deployment: FastAPI app fully containerized with Nginx, and deployed to Cloud Run (see atomic_tasks.yaml: GCP-1.A.*, CI-1.2, CI-1.4)

## Next Sprint: SaaS Quality Enhancements & Product Features
- Goal: Add reliability, observability, core product features (auth, feedback), and improve AI content quality.
- Milestones:
  - [x] Robust Job Processing: Firestore job persistence and Cloud Tasks integration for async operations (see atomic_tasks.yaml: API-2.5)
  - [x] Workflow Orchestration: Implement Cloud Workflows for complex generation pipelines (see atomic_tasks.yaml: GCP-1.B.8.* and future WF-* tasks)
  - [x] Monitoring & Cost Control: Implement AI token/cost tracking and basic observability (see atomic_tasks.yaml: AI-5.4 and future MON-* tasks)
  - [~] User Authentication: End-to-end user registration and login (see atomic_tasks.yaml: API-2.2, API-2.3, FE-3.1, FE-3.4)
  - [~] Content Interaction: User feedback system for content (see atomic_tasks.yaml: API-2.7, FE-3.5, AI-5.3)
  - [x] AI Quality: Improved prompt engineering and content post-processing (see atomic_tasks.yaml: AI-5.1, AI-5.2)
  - [x] Developer Experience: Enhanced documentation and local development setup (see atomic_tasks.yaml: DEV-6.2, DEV-6.3)

## Sprint: Core Content Generation Refactoring (Autonomous)
