## MVP Finalization Sprint - 10 Hour Execution Block (New Plan - 2025-05-29)

**Overarching Goal for this 10-hour block:** Achieve significant progress towards a functional MVP, focusing on completing critical backend enhancements (already done prior to this specific plan), establishing frontend CI/CD and DevEx, and building out the core frontend user flow from authentication to content generation and basic feedback.

**Context:** The backend AI enhancements (AI-5.1: Prompt Externalization, AI-5.2: Grammar/Style Post-Processing, AI-5.4: Token/Cost Tracking) were completed in a previous session. This 10-hour plan picks up from there.

**Detailed Phased Plan (Target: ~10 Hours Autonomous Execution):**

**Phase 1: Frontend CI/CD & Developer Experience Polish (Est. 1.5 - 2 hours)**
*   **Task `CI-FE-1.1`: Configure GitHub Actions for frontend CI** (`done`)
    *   **Objective:** Automate frontend testing, linting, building.
    *   **Action:**
        1.  Confirm frontend build scripts from `frontend/package.json` (scripts: `lint`, `test -- --run`, `build`).
        2.  Create/update `.github/workflows/frontend-ci.yml`:
            *   Trigger on push/PR to `main`/`develop` for paths `frontend/**` and the workflow file.
            *   Setup Node.js (e.g., v18 LTS).
            *   Use `npm ci` (caching `frontend/package-lock.json`).
            *   Run `npm run lint`.
            *   Run `npm run test -- --run`.
            *   Run `npm run build`.
*   **Task `DEV-6.3`: DevEx: Pre-commit Hooks Setup (Frontend)** (`done`)
    *   **Objective:** Automate local code quality checks for frontend.
    *   **Action:**
        1.  **Frontend Setup (Husky & lint-staged):**
            *   Install dev dependencies: `npm install --save-dev husky lint-staged` (in `frontend/`).
            *   Initialize Husky: `npx husky init` (in `frontend/`).
            *   Configure `lint-staged` in `frontend/package.json` to run `eslint --fix` and `prettier --write` on staged `*.{ts,tsx}` files.
            *   Create `frontend/.husky/pre-commit` hook to run `npx lint-staged`.
        2.  Document frontend pre-commit setup in `README.md`.

**Phase 2: Core Frontend - Authentication & API Foundation (Est. 2 - 2.5 hours)**
*   **Task `FE-3.1`: User Registration & Login (API/Context & Forms)**
    *   **Action (API & Auth Context):**
        1.  Enhance `frontend/src/api.ts`: Axios instance (`baseURL: /api/v1`), JWT request interceptor, basic response error interceptor.
        2.  Create `frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` (or Zustand store): Manage `user`, `token`, `isAuthenticated`; provide `login()`, `logout()`; handle `localStorage` persistence.
        3.  Wrap `frontend/src/App.tsx` with `AuthProvider`.
    *   **Action (Auth Forms & Routing):**
        1.  Create `RegisterPage.tsx`, `LoginPage.tsx`.
        2.  Create `RegistrationForm.tsx`, `LoginForm.tsx` (functional, Tailwind CSS styling).
        3.  Implement form submissions to `/auth/register` & `/auth/login`, use `AuthContext`, handle success/error messages, implement redirection.
        4.  Add routes in `frontend/src/App.tsx`. Create basic `HomePage.tsx` (placeholder for after login) and `ProtectedRoutes.tsx` HOC.

**Phase 3: Core Frontend - Content Generation & Job Management (Est. 3.5 - 4 hours)**
*   **Task `FE-3.2`: Content Generation Form**
    *   **Action:**
        1.  Create `GeneratePage.tsx` (protected route).
        2.  Create `ContentGeneratorForm.tsx`: `syllabus_text` (textarea), `target_format` (select: Podcast, Study Guide, etc.), optional `target_duration`, `target_pages`.
        3.  Implement submission to `/jobs` POST endpoint. Handle loading/errors. On success, navigate to job status page.
*   **Task `FE-3.3`: Job Status Display & Basic Results**
    *   **Action:**
        1.  Create `JobStatusPage.tsx` (protected, parameterized by `job_id`).
        2.  Create `JobStatusDisplay.tsx`: Poll `/jobs/{job_id}`; display status text; if `COMPLETED`, display `content_outline.title`, `content_outline.overview`.
        3.  Create `ContentDisplay.tsx` (basic): Render key fields of `ContentOutline` and the primary `content` string from the job result in a readable format.
*   **Task `FE-3.4`: Logout Functionality**
    *   **Action:** Add Logout button (e.g., in a shared `Navbar.tsx`) using `AuthContext`.

**Phase 4: Basic Feedback UI, UX Polish & E2E Smoke Test (Est. 2 - 2.5 hours)**
*   **Task `FE-3.5`: Content Feedback UI (Basic)**
    *   **Action:** On content display, add "Like" / "Dislike" buttons; implement API call to `/content/{job_id}/feedback`.
*   **Task `UX-4.2` (Simplified): Basic Loading States & Error Modals**
    *   **Action:** Implement text-based loading indicators. Create a simple global error modal/toast system (e.g., using a new `ErrorContext.tsx`) for API errors.
*   **(Stretch Goal if time permits) Task `UX-4.1` (Simplified Onboarding):**
    *   Create a very simple modal shown on first login (use `localStorage`) briefly explaining the app's purpose.
*   **E2E Smoke Test:** Manually test Register -> Login -> Generate -> View Status/Result -> Basic Feedback -> Logout.

**Deferred Tasks (Beyond this 10-hour block, from full checklist):**
*   Full implementation of `UX-4.1` (multi-step Onboarding Wizard).
*   Full implementation of `UX-4.2` (detailed Skeleton Screens).
*   Comprehensive E2E Test Suite development.
*   `AI-5.3` (Full verification of feedback system, including analytics/usage).
*   Remaining Documentation updates (`architecture-map.md`, `feature-tracker.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` finalization).
*   Monitoring Setup verification.
*   Full Deployment & Production Verification steps.
*   Performance Validation against specific targets.
*   Handover phase.

This revised 10-hour plan is more aggressive on the frontend side, aiming for a more complete user flow.
