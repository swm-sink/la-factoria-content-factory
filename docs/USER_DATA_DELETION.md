# User Data Deletion System

This document describes the comprehensive user data deletion system implemented in Step 23 of the La Factoria improvement plan, designed for full GDPR compliance and user privacy protection.

## Overview

The user data deletion system provides a complete solution for handling user data deletion requests in compliance with GDPR "Right to Erasure" requirements. The system includes automated data discovery, secure verification processes, comprehensive audit trails, and complete data removal across all storage systems.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Data Models** (`app/models/user_data_deletion.py`)
   - `UserDataDeletionRequest`: Main deletion request model
   - `DeletionTask`: Individual deletion tasks per data location
   - `DataInventory`: User data discovery results
   - `DeletionSummary`: Completion summary and verification
   - `GDPRComplianceReport`: Compliance reporting and metrics

2. **Deletion Service** (`app/services/user_data_deletion.py`)
   - Automated data discovery across all systems
   - Secure verification and processing workflow
   - Complete data removal with verification checksums
   - Comprehensive audit trail management

3. **API Endpoints** (`app/api/routes/user_data_deletion.py`)
   - User-initiated deletion requests
   - Admin deletion management
   - Verification and processing endpoints
   - Compliance reporting and metrics

4. **Data Discovery Engine**
   - Automatic detection of user data across Firestore and Redis
   - Categorization by data type (profile, content, usage logs, etc.)
   - Retention policy compliance checking
   - Backup location tracking

## Features

### GDPR Compliance

- **Right to Erasure**: Complete implementation of GDPR Article 17
- **Data Portability**: Export functionality before deletion
- **Legal Basis Tracking**: Documentation of deletion reasons
- **Retention Policies**: Automated compliance with data retention requirements
- **Audit Requirements**: 7-year audit trail retention for compliance reporting

### Data Discovery

The system automatically discovers user data across all storage systems:

```python
# Firestore Collections
- users (profile data)
- content_jobs (user-generated content)
- user_sessions (usage tracking)
- api_usage (analytics data)
- billing_records (financial data - 7 year retention)
- audit_logs (compliance data - 7 year retention)

# Redis Cache
- user_cache (temporary data)
- session_cache (session data)
```

### Verification Process

1. **Token Generation**: Secure verification tokens with configurable expiration
2. **Multi-factor Verification**: Email verification for user-initiated requests
3. **Admin Override**: Administrative approval for complex cases
4. **Legal Hold Check**: Automated checking for legal preservation requirements

### Deletion Scopes

- **ALL_DATA**: Complete user data removal (default)
- **CONTENT_ONLY**: Remove only user-generated content
- **METADATA_ONLY**: Remove only profile and metadata
- **CUSTOM**: Selective deletion by data category

## Configuration

### System Configuration

```python
class DeletionConfiguration:
    enabled: bool = True
    require_verification: bool = True
    verification_timeout_hours: int = 24
    auto_verify_admin_requests: bool = False
    legal_hold_check_required: bool = True

    notification_email_template: str = "deletion_notification"
    backup_cleanup_enabled: bool = True
    audit_retention_years: int = 7
```

### Data Location Configuration

Each data location is configured with:

- **System**: Storage system (firestore, redis)
- **Database/Collection**: Specific database and table/collection
- **Identifier Field**: Field used to identify user data
- **Data Types**: Categories of data stored
- **Retention Period**: Legal retention requirements
- **Encryption Status**: Data encryption status
- **Backup Locations**: Associated backup storage

## Workflow

### Standard User Deletion Flow

1. **Request Creation**

   ```
   User → API Request → Verification Token → Email Notification
   ```

2. **Verification**

   ```
   User Clicks Link → Token Validation → Request Verified
   ```

3. **Processing**

   ```
   Data Discovery → Task Creation → Data Deletion → Verification → Completion
   ```

4. **Audit Trail**

   ```
   Each Step → Audit Entry → Compliance Record → Long-term Storage
   ```

### Admin Deletion Flow

1. **Admin Request**

   ```
   Admin → Direct Request → Legal Hold Check → Processing
   ```

2. **Automatic Processing** (if configured)

   ```
   Auto-verification → Immediate Processing → Completion
   ```

## Security & Privacy

### Data Protection

- **Encryption in Transit**: All API communications use HTTPS/TLS
- **Encryption at Rest**: Sensitive data encrypted in storage
- **Access Control**: Role-based access with authentication
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail for all operations

### Privacy Safeguards

- **Data Minimization**: Only necessary data is accessed during deletion
- **Purpose Limitation**: Deletion system access limited to deletion purposes
- **Retention Limits**: Automatic cleanup of deletion metadata after completion
- **No Data Exposure**: Deletion process doesn't expose user data in logs

### Verification Security

- **Secure Tokens**: Cryptographically secure verification tokens
- **Time Limits**: Configurable expiration for verification tokens
- **Single Use**: Verification tokens are single-use only
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against verification token abuse
