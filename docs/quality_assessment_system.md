## Quality Thresholds

Based on La Factoria educational standards:

- **Overall Quality Threshold**: ≥0.70 for content acceptance
- **Educational Value Threshold**: ≥0.75 for learning effectiveness  
- **Factual Accuracy Threshold**: ≥0.85 for information reliability

## Assessment Dimensions

### 1. Educational Effectiveness (30% weight)
**Purpose**: Measure pedagogical value and learning outcomes potential

**Assessment Criteria**:
- Presence of clear learning objectives
- Educational content structure and organization
- Practice opportunities and examples
- Real-world application connections
- Learning indicator density analysis

**Scoring Bands**:
- **Excellent (0.9-1.0)**: Clear objectives, comprehensive examples, strong pedagogical structure
- **Good (0.7-0.89)**: Basic educational structure, some examples and practice opportunities
- **Needs Improvement (0.5-0.69)**: Limited educational value, weak structure
- **Poor (0.0-0.49)**: No clear educational purpose or structure

### 2. Factual Accuracy (25% weight)
**Purpose**: Ensure information reliability and prevent misinformation

**Assessment Methods**:
- **Red Flag Detection**: Common misconceptions and factual errors
- **Uncertainty Language**: Appropriate use of scientific uncertainty
- **Citation Indicators**: Presence of source references and research backing
- **Overconfidence Detection**: Identification of inappropriately certain claims

**Common Red Flags Detected**:
- Scientific misconceptions (flat earth, vaccine misinformation)
- Mathematical errors (basic arithmetic mistakes)
- Historical inaccuracies (Columbus "discovering" America)
- Common myths (Napoleon's height, Great Wall visibility from space)

### 3. Age Appropriateness (15% weight)
**Purpose**: Ensure content complexity matches target audience cognitive abilities

**Readability Metrics**:
- Flesch Reading Ease calculation
- Average sentence length analysis
- Syllable complexity assessment
- Vocabulary difficulty evaluation

**Age Group Thresholds**:
- **Elementary**: 80+ Flesch score (very easy reading)
- **Middle School**: 70+ Flesch score (fairly easy)
- **High School**: 60+ Flesch score (standard difficulty)
- **College**: 50+ Flesch score (fairly difficult)

### 4. Learning Objective Alignment (10% weight)
**Purpose**: Validate content alignment with specified learning goals

**Assessment Process**:
- Keyword matching for subject areas and skills
- Cognitive level verification
- Learning outcome alignment checking
- Educational goal coherence validation

### 5. Cognitive Load Assessment (10% weight)
**Purpose**: Apply Cognitive Load Theory to optimize learning effectiveness

**Three Load Types**:
- **Intrinsic Load**: Content complexity and concept difficulty
- **Extraneous Load**: Presentation and formatting complexity  
- **Germane Load**: Learning effort and schema construction

**Age-Appropriate Thresholds**:
- Elementary: ≤1.5 total cognitive load
- Middle School: ≤2.0 total cognitive load
- High School: ≤2.5 total cognitive load
- College: ≤3.0 total cognitive load

### 6. Structural Quality (5% weight)
**Purpose**: Evaluate content organization and navigation

**Assessment Elements**:
- Clear headings and subheadings
- Logical information hierarchy
- Paragraph breaks and formatting
- List organization and bullet points
- Content type specific structure requirements

### 7. Engagement Level (5% weight)
**Purpose**: Measure student engagement potential

**Engagement Indicators**:
- Interactive questions and activities
- Real-world examples and applications
- Thought-provoking discussion prompts
- Hands-on practice opportunities
- Personal relevance connections

## Bloom's Taxonomy Integration

### Cognitive Level Assessment
The system evaluates content against Bloom's taxonomy levels appropriate for each age group:

**Elementary Focus**: Remember, Understand, Apply
**Middle School**: Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze  
**High School**: Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate
**College**: Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create

### Keyword Detection
Advanced keyword analysis identifies cognitive level indicators:
- **Remember**: recall, recognize, identify, define, describe
- **Understand**: explain, interpret, summarize, classify, compare
- **Apply**: use, implement, execute, practice, solve
- **Analyze**: examine, investigate, categorize, differentiate
- **Evaluate**: assess, judge, critique, justify, argue
- **Create**: design, develop, construct, produce, generate

## Quality Improvement Suggestions

The system generates specific, actionable improvement recommendations:

### Educational Effectiveness (< 0.75)
- Add clear learning objectives at content beginning
- Include more practical examples to illustrate concepts
- Add practice exercises for hands-on learning
- Provide summary sections for concept reinforcement
- Connect content to real-world applications

### Factual Accuracy (< 0.85)
- Verify all factual claims with reliable sources
- Add appropriate uncertainty language where needed
- Include citations for key information
- Review content for common misconceptions
- Subject matter expert review for technical content

### Structural Quality (< 0.70)
- Add clear headings and subheadings
- Use bullet points for key information
- Include paragraph breaks for readability
- Add introduction and conclusion sections
- Ensure logical flow from simple to complex

### Engagement (< 0.65)
- Add interactive questions throughout content
- Include thought-provoking discussion questions
- Use concrete examples from everyday life
- Add opportunities for self-reflection
- Incorporate active participation activities

## Usage Examples

### Basic Quality Assessment
```python
from services.quality_assessor import EducationalQualityAssessor

assessor = EducationalQualityAssessor()

result = await assessor.assess_content_quality(
    content=generated_content,
    content_type="study_guide",
    age_group="high_school",
    learning_objectives=learning_objectives
)

# Check if content meets quality thresholds
if result["meets_quality_threshold"]:
    print("Content approved for publication")
else:
    print("Content needs improvement")
    for suggestion in result["quality_improvement_suggestions"]:
        print(f"- {suggestion}")
```

### Quality Threshold Enforcement
```python
# Automatic regeneration for below-threshold content
if not result["meets_educational_threshold"]:
    improved_content = await regenerate_with_improvements(
        original_request, 
        result["quality_improvement_suggestions"]
    )
```

### Quality Analytics
```python
# Track quality metrics over time
quality_trends = {
    "average_overall_score": calculate_average(quality_scores),
    "educational_effectiveness_trend": track_trend(educational_scores),
    "common_improvement_areas": analyze_suggestions(all_suggestions)
}
```

## Integration Points

### Content Generation Service
The quality assessor integrates directly with the educational content service:

```python
# In EducationalContentService.generate_educational_content()
quality_scores = await self.quality_assessor.assess_content_quality(
    content=parsed_content,
    content_type=content_type,
    age_group=age_group,
    learning_objectives=learning_objectives
)

# Enforce quality thresholds
if quality_scores["overall_quality_score"] < 0.70:
    # Trigger regeneration with improvement guidance
    return await self.regenerate_with_improvements(request, quality_scores)
```

### API Endpoints
Quality assessment runs automatically for all content generation:

```python
@router.post("/api/v1/content/generate/{content_type}")
async def generate_content(request: ContentGenerationRequest):
    result = await content_service.generate_educational_content(...)
    
    # Quality assessment included in response
    return {
        "generated_content": result["content"],
        "quality_metrics": result["quality_metrics"],
        "meets_standards": result["quality_metrics"]["meets_quality_threshold"]
    }
```
