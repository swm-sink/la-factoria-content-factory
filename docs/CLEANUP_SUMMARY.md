# AI Content Factory - Cleanup Summary

**Date**: June 1, 2025
**Purpose**: Summary of cleanup work performed before AI context dump export

## Cleanup Actions Completed âœ…

### 1. Documentation Updates
- **Created `docs/CURRENT_STATUS.md`**: Honest assessment of actual project state (51.8% tests passing)
- **Updated `docs/CHANGELOG.md`**: Documented today's sklearn refactor and test fixes
- **Updated `scripts/generate_ai_context_dump.py`**: Added current status and test infrastructure reports to context dump

### 2. Key Fixes Today
- Resolved sklearn dependency blocking issues
- Implemented lightweight NLP utilities
- Fixed content generation service tests
- Updated API endpoint paths in tests

### 3. Context Dump Preparation
The AI context dump script will now include:
- Project rules (.cursor/rules/project.mdc)
- Main application (app/main.py)
- Unit tests (tests/unit/test_app.py)
- Requirements, Dockerfile, README
- Task files (meta_tasks, atomic_tasks, task_details)
- **NEW: Current Status (docs/CURRENT_STATUS.md)**
- **NEW: Test Infrastructure Status (reports/test_infrastructure_status.md)**
- CHANGELOG with today's updates

## Ready for Export

You can now run the context dump script:
```bash
python scripts/generate_ai_context_dump.py
```

This will create `ai_context_dump.md` in the project root with an accurate picture of the project's current state.

## Remaining Cleanup (Optional)

If time permits before export:
1. Archive overly optimistic completion reports in `docs/PROJECT_COMPLETION_STATUS.md`
2. Consolidate duplicate test files (test_app*.py variants)
3. Update README.md to reflect actual state

## Key Takeaway

The project has made significant progress but is NOT production-ready. The context dump will now accurately reflect this reality, making it easier for you or others to understand what needs to be done.
