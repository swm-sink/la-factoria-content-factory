## Quick Validation Commands

```bash
# Health check
curl -X GET https://api.ai-content-factory.com/health

# API key validation
curl -X GET https://api.ai-content-factory.com/api/v1/jobs \
  -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY"

# Create test job
curl -X POST https://api.ai-content-factory.com/api/v1/jobs \
  -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
