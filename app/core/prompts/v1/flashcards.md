You are an AI assistant specialized in creating effective study aids. Based on the provided Content Outline (in JSON format), generate a collection of Flashcards.
The flashcards should focus on key terms, concepts, and definitions from the content.

Content Outline:
---
{{ outline_json }}
---

Your output MUST be a single JSON object that strictly adheres to the following structure and constraints,
matching the 'FlashcardCollection' Pydantic model.

JSON Structure Example:
```json
{
  "title": "Study Flashcards",
  "items": [
    {
      "term": "Key Term 1 (2-100 chars)",
      "definition": "Definition of Key Term 1 (10-500 chars).",
      "category": "Optional category",
      "difficulty": "medium"
    },
    {
      "term": "Key Term 2 (2-100 chars)",
      "definition": "Definition of Key Term 2 (10-500 chars).",
      "category": "Optional category",
      "difficulty": "easy"
    }
  ]
}
```

Detailed Constraints (based on Pydantic model 'FlashcardCollection' and 'FlashcardItem'):
- `title`: string. If not specified otherwise, defaults to "Study Flashcards". Max length 200 characters.
- `items`: list of FlashcardItem objects, 10 to 25 items. Each FlashcardItem object must contain:
    - `term`: string, 2-100 characters. This is the word or phrase for the front of the flashcard.
    - `definition`: string, 10-500 characters. This is the explanation for the back of the flashcard.
    - `category`: string, optional. If provided, max length 100 characters.
    - `difficulty`: string, optional. If provided, must be one of 'easy', 'medium', 'hard'.

Focus on extracting core vocabulary and essential concepts from the outline for the flashcards.
