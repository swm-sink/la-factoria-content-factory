# Project Task Tracker

This file serves as a simple tracker for project issues, tasks, and sub-tasks.

## Summary of Progress

- Local development environment fully set up (Python 3.13.3, pip, Git, gcloud, Docker).
- GCP project created, billing linked, budget alerts set, and required APIs enabled.
- Minimal Flask "Hello World" app scaffolded, linted, and containerized with Docker.
- Initial Vertex AI Gemini and ElevenLabs integration completed with basic content generation.
- Local testing commands generated.
- All steps are logged with timestamps and session references for traceability.

## Issues

- [ ] Investigate using a more robust task tracking system later (e.g., GitHub Issues, Jira) if needed.
- [ ] Unit tests for `/generate-content` endpoint in `test_app.py` are currently failing due to challenges in mocking dependencies (Vertex AI initialization) during module import. Requires further investigation or code refactoring for improved testability.
- [ ] Current content generation is limited to basic podcast script and study guide. Need to expand to include content outline, one-pager summaries, detailed reading materials, FAQs, flashcards, and reading guide questions.
