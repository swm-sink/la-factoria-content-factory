# Project Task Tracker

This file serves as a simple tracker for project issues, tasks, and sub-tasks.

## Summary of Progress

- Local development environment fully set up (Python 3.13.3, pip, Git, gcloud, Docker).
- GCP project created, billing linked, budget alerts set, and required APIs enabled.
- Minimal Flask "Hello World" app scaffolded, linted, and containerized with Docker.
- Initial Vertex AI Gemini and ElevenLabs integration completed with basic content generation.
- Local testing commands generated.
- All steps are logged with timestamps and session references for traceability.

## Issues

- [ ] Investigate using a more robust task tracking system later (e.g., GitHub Issues, Jira) if needed.
- [ ] Unit tests for `/generate-content` endpoint in `test_app.py` are currently failing due to challenges in mocking dependencies (Vertex AI initialization) during module import. Requires further investigation or code refactoring for improved testability.
- [ ] Current content generation is limited to basic podcast script and study guide. Need to expand to include content outline, one-pager summaries, detailed reading materials, FAQs, flashcards, and reading guide questions.

  - Outcome/Notes: Updated project.mdc with expanded content types (Content Outline, Summaries, Reading Materials) and new AI interaction/IaC/modularity rules. Ready for application refactoring.

- [ ] **Task 6: Refactor Application for Expanded Content Scope** (2024-06-09 17:35) [AI-EXECUTION-SESSION-20240609-1735]
  - Description: Implement Content Outline, One-Pager Summaries, Detailed Reading Materials, and update existing formats as per revised project.mdc.
  - Outcome/Notes: Pending implementation
  - Sub-Tasks:
    - [ ] Refactor `main.py`: Update Gemini prompt to generate content outline first, then all other defined content types (podcast script, study guide, one-pager summaries, detailed reading materials, FAQs, flashcards, reading guide questions) in the specified single JSON structure. Update JSON parsing and API response structure.
    - [ ] Apply proactive modularity rules to `main.py` if `generate_content_and_audio` function (or its successor) becomes overly complex.
    - [ ] Refactor `test_app.py`: Update mocks and assertions for the new expanded content structure and API response.
    - [ ] Verify and update `requirements.txt` if any new libraries are needed for the refactoring (unlikely for this specific change but good to check).
    - [ ] Update `CHANGELOG.md` to document the expanded capabilities once refactoring is complete and tested.
