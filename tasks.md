# Project Task Tracker

## Current Sprint Focus (Next ~2 Weeks) - Foundational Stability & Cleanup - COMPLETED

### Execution Path 1: Settings & Security (Priority) - COMPLETED
**Goal**: Secure and consolidate all application settings with proper environment variable 
handling and security measures. Ensure `app/main.py` (and all components) use these 
settings.

- [x] Task 1.5: Consolidate settings into single source of truth 
[AI-EXECUTION-SESSION-20250527]
- [x] Task 1.6: Remove default insecure `API_KEY` from `app/core/config/settings.py` 
[AI-EXECUTION-SESSION-20250527]
- [x] Task 1.7: Review and ensure all critical settings in `app/core/config/settings.py` 
are correctly defined [AI-EXECUTION-SESSION-20250528]
- [x] Task 1.8: Implement Google Secret Manager integration for sensitive settings 
[AI-EXECUTION-SESSION-20250528]
- [x] Task 1.9: Add comprehensive Google-style docstrings to `app/core/config/settings.py` 
and `app/core/security/secrets.py` [AI-EXECUTION-SESSION-20250528]

### Execution Path 2: Core Service Strategy & API Alignment - COMPLETED
**Goal**: Align the API (`app/main.py` and `app/api/routes/`) to use the 
`EnhancedMultiStepContentGenerationService` from `app/services/
multi_step_content_generation.py` as the primary service for content generation.

- [x] Task 2.1: Designate `EnhancedMultiStepContentGenerationService` as primary & 
Refactor API to use it [AI-EXECUTION-SESSION-20250528]
    *   [x] Verified `app/main.py` API endpoint uses 
    `EnhancedMultiStepContentGenerationService` and compatible Pydantic models.
    *   [x] Created/Updated `app/core/docs/service_architecture.md` to reflect 
    `EnhancedMultiStepContentGenerationService` as primary.
    *   [x] Deprecated the simple `app/services/content_generation.py` with warnings and 
    docstring updates.

- [x] Task 2.2: Adapt API for Asynchronous Job-Based Workflow 
[AI-EXECUTION-SESSION-PREVIOUS]
    *   Dependencies: Task 2.1
    *   Files: Created and implemented:
        *   `app/core/schemas/job.py`: Pydantic models for job management.
        *   `app/api/routes/jobs.py`: API endpoints for job operations.
        *   `app/services/job_manager.py`: Job lifecycle management service.
    *   Steps:
        *   Created job schema with status tracking, progress monitoring, and error 
        handling.
        *   Implemented RESTful job management endpoints (create, list, get, update, 
        delete).
        *   The `create_job` endpoint now accepts `ContentRequest` directly.
        *   `JobManager` now uses `ContentRequest` from `job.metadata` to call 
        `EnhancedMultiStepContentGenerationService` for actual content generation 
        (executed in a separate thread).
        *   Basic result and error state from content generation service are stored in the 
        Job object.
        *   Updated main API router to include job endpoints.
    *   Success Criteria: Asynchronous job system framework implemented with API support 
    and core content generation processing.
    *   **Pending Enhancements / Skipped Items (deferred until after E2E async testing):**
        *   **Detailed Real-time Progress Tracking:** Current progress updates in 
        `JobManager._process_job` are placeholders. True real-time progress requires 
        deeper integration with `EnhancedMultiStepContentGenerationService`'s internal 
        `ProgressTracker` (e.g., via callbacks or a shared observable state).
        *   **Job Persistence:** The `JobManager` currently stores jobs in-memory. For 
        production, job state needs to be persisted to a database (e.g., SQLite, 
        PostgreSQL). This is a significant next step (see Execution Path 4).
        *   **Advanced Error Handling & Retries:** While basic error state is captured, 
        more granular error codes from the content generation process and retry mechanisms 
        for transient issues could be implemented.
        *   **Scalability & Resource Management:** For a high number of concurrent jobs, a 
        more robust worker system (e.g., Celery, or careful management of `asyncio.
        to_thread` with resource limits) and strategies for managing external API rate 
        limits are needed (see Execution Path 5).

- [x] Task 2.3: Refactor API Routers to be fully within `app/api/routes/` 
[AI-EXECUTION-SESSION-20250528]
    *   [x] Created `app/api/routes/content.py`.
    *   [x] Moved `/api/generate-content` and `/api/health` endpoint logic to `app/api/
    routes/content.py`.
    *   [x] Created `app/api/routes.py` to aggregate routers.
    *   [x] Updated `app/main.py` to use the main `api_router` with prefix.

### Execution Path 3: Backend Dependencies & Cleanup - COMPLETED
**Goal**: Resolve dependency conflicts, ensure proper version management, and remove 
obsolete code.

- [x] Task 3.1: Resolve `pytest` version conflict & standardize usage 
[AI-EXECUTION-SESSION-20250528]
- [x] Task 3.2: Resolve `pydantic` & `pydantic-settings` versions (ensure Pydantic V2) 
[AI-EXECUTION-SESSION-20250528]
- [x] Task 3.3: Clean up `requirements.txt` (move all dev dependencies) 
[AI-EXECUTION-SESSION-20250528]

- [x] Task 3.4: Full Review & Cleanup/Deletion of `backend/` directory 
[AI-EXECUTION-SESSION-PREVIOUS]
    *   Dependencies: Execution Paths 1 & 2 fully completed and stable (or Task 2.2 
    deferred).
    *   Files: Entire `backend/` directory.
    *   Steps:
        1.  **Final Confirmation**: Verified all functionality from `backend/app/` is 
        covered by `app/`.
        2.  Checked `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` point to `app.main:app` and 
        updated them.
        3.  Created a final backup of `backend/` to `backend_backup/`.
        4.  Deleted the `backend/` directory.
        5.  Removed `__pycache__` directories from `app/`.
    *   Success Criteria: `backend/` removed; app structure consolidated into `app/`. 
    Docker configurations updated.
    *   **Pending Items (to be addressed later / User Action Required):**
        *   **Python 3.13 `pydantic-core` Build Issue (User Action for Local Dev):** Local 
        `pytest` execution with Python 3.13 encounters build failures for `pydantic-core`. 
        Workaround `PYO3_USE_ABI3_FORWARD_COMPATIBILITY=1` helps but a permanent fix is 
        needed if local Python 3.13 testing is a priority.
        *   **`.env` File Creation (User Action for Testing):** A `.env` file at the 
        project root is required for `docker-compose` to run successfully and for local 
        testing if Secret Manager is not configured locally. It should contain essential 
        variables like `API_KEY`, `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`, `GCP_PROJECT_ID`.

## NEW SPRINT FOCUS: Enable End-to-End Testing of Asynchronous Job System - COMPLETED
**Goal**: Make the asynchronous content generation flow fully functional and testable, 
from job creation to retrieving generated content, with basic but meaningful progress 
indication.

- [x] **Task A: Add Missing Job Parameters (`target_duration`, `target_pages`)**
    - [x] **Sub-task A.1:** Update `app/api/routes/content.py`'s `ContentRequest` model to 
    include `target_duration: Optional[float] = None` and `target_pages: Optional[int] = 
    None`.
    - [x] **Sub-task A.2:** Ensure `JobManager._process_job` correctly extracts these from 
    `job.metadata` (derived from `ContentRequest`) and passes them to `self.
    _content_service.generate_long_form_content`.
    - [x] **Sub-task A.3:** Verify OpenAPI schema (auto-generated docs) for the `/jobs` 
    endpoint reflects these new optional parameters in the request body.

- [x] **Task B: Improve Placeholder Progress Updates in `JobManager`**
    - [x] **Sub-task B.1:** Analyze the main stages in 
    `EnhancedMultiStepContentGenerationService.generate_long_form_content` (e.g., Cache 
    Check, Topic Decomposition, Section Generation, Assembly, Quality Eval, Versioning).
    - [x] **Sub-task B.2:** Modify `JobManager._process_job` to update `Job.progress` with 
    more meaningful `current_step` messages and `percentage` estimates that roughly 
    correspond to these actual service stages.

- [x] **Task C: Document Manual User Steps Required for Testing (User Action Required)**
    - [x] **Sub-task C.1:** (User Action) Create `.env` file at project root with `API_KEY`, 
    `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`, `GCP_PROJECT_ID` for Dockerized testing and local testing if 
    Secret Manager is not used locally. (Documentation updated in README.md)
    - [x] **Sub-task C.2:** (User Action) For local testing on Python 3.13 outside Docker, the 
    `pydantic-core` build issue may require setting 
    `PYO3_USE_ABI3_FORWARD_COMPATIBILITY=1` or other resolution. (Documentation updated in README.md)

## CURRENT SPRINT FOCUS: Transition to GCP-Native Serverless Architecture

**Goal**: Migrate the application to a fully managed, scalable, and robust serverless architecture on Google Cloud Platform. This involves setting up core GCP infrastructure, refactoring job management to use Firestore and Cloud Tasks, implementing Cloud Workflows for orchestration, and leveraging API Gateway and other GCP services for a production-grade deployment.

### Phase 1: Core GCP Infrastructure Setup & IaC
**Goal**: Establish the foundational GCP services and manage them using Infrastructure as Code (Terraform).

    - [ ] **Cloud Run Service**: Define `google_cloud_run_v2_service`.
        - Configure container image source (Artifact Registry).
        - Set environment variables (placeholders, to be linked with Secret Manager).
        - Define scaling, CPU, memory, and ingress settings.
    - [ ] **Artifact Registry**: Define `google_artifact_registry_repository` for Docker images.
    - [ ] **Secret Manager**:
        - [ ] Define `google_secret_manager_secret` for application secrets (API keys, DB creds - actual values added manually or via CI/CD).
        - [ ] Define IAM bindings (`google_secret_manager_secret_iam_member`) to allow Cloud Run service account access.
- [ ] **Task GCP-1.4: Terraform for Core Services - Part 2**
    - [ ] **Firestore Database**: Define `google_firestore_database` (Native mode).
        - Define `google_firestore_index` as needed for job queries later.
    - [ ] **Cloud Tasks Queues**: Define `google_cloud_tasks_queue` for content generation jobs.
        - Configure retry policies, rate limits.
    - [ ] **API Gateway**:
        - [ ] Define `google_api_gateway_api`, `google_api_gateway_api_config`, `google_api_gateway_gateway`.
        - [ ] Create OpenAPI spec (`openapi.yaml`) for API Gateway configuration, initially for health check and job endpoints.
        - [ ] Configure to route to Cloud Run service.
- [ ] **Task GCP-1.5: Terraform for Observability & Orchestration (Initial Stubs)**
    - [ ] **Cloud Logging/Monitoring**: Basic setup (often default, but define any specific sinks or metrics if known).
    - [ ] **Cloud Workflows**: Define `google_workflows_workflow` (placeholder for now, to be detailed in a later phase).
- [ ] **Task GCP-1.6: IAM & Service Accounts**
    - [ ] Define dedicated service account for the Cloud Run application.
    - [ ] Grant minimal necessary permissions to this service account for accessing other GCP services (Firestore, Vertex AI, Cloud Tasks, Secret Manager).
- [ ] **Task GCP-1.7: Local Development & Testing with GCP Emulators (Optional but Recommended)**
    - [ ] Document setup for Firestore Emulator, Pub/Sub Emulator (if Cloud Tasks uses it indirectly), etc.
    - [ ] Update development scripts/`docker-compose.override.yml` to use emulators.

**Next Steps for this Phase:**
1. Begin Task GCP-1.1: GCP Project Setup & API Enablement.
2. Proceed to Task GCP-1.2: Terraform Setup & Initial Configuration.
3. Continue with subsequent Terraform tasks (GCP-1.3 to GCP-1.6).

## Previous Sprint Focus (Foundational Stability & Cleanup) - COMPLETED 
**(Duplicated Section for historical reference only - tasks are identical to the first section with this title)**

### Execution Path 1: Settings & Security (Priority) - COMPLETED
### Execution Path 2: Core Service Strategy & API Alignment - COMPLETED
### Execution Path 3: Backend Dependencies & Cleanup - COMPLETED

---
## Phase 2: SaaS Quality Enhancements (Post-GCP Transition Phase 1)
**Note:** These tasks are adapted to leverage the new GCP-Native Serverless Architecture.

### Execution Path 4: Reliability & Resilience (GCP Focused)
**Goal**: Enhance the application's ability to handle failures gracefully, ensure data 
integrity, and recover from errors, using GCP services.

- **Task 4.1: Implement Job Persistence for Asynchronous System using Firestore**
    - **Sub-task 4.1.1: Database Technology Chosen: Firestore (Native Mode).** (Decision made as part of GCP architecture)
    - **Sub-task 4.1.2: Define Firestore Document Model for Jobs.**
        - Goal: Translate `Job` Pydantic model to a Firestore document structure.
        - Proposed Schema (conceptual for Firestore):
          ```json
          {
            "id": "string (UUID)",
            "status": "string (pending, processing, completed, failed, cancelled)",
            "created_at": "timestamp",
            "updated_at": "timestamp",
            "completed_at": "timestamp (optional)",
            "error": { // JobError model
              "code": "string (JobErrorCode)",
              "message": "string",
              "details": "string (optional)"
            },
            "progress": { // JobProgress model
              "current_step": "string",
              "total_steps": "integer",
              "percentage": "float",
              "completed_steps": ["string"]
            },
            "result": "map (JSON structure of the job result)",
            "metadata": "map (JSON structure of ContentRequest)"
          }
          ```
        - Considerations: Use Firestore server timestamps for `created_at`, `updated_at`.
        - Plan for indexing critical fields for querying (e.g., `status`, `user_id` if applicable, `created_at`).
    - **Sub-task 4.1.3: Implement Firestore Interaction Logic in `JobManager`.**
        - Replace in-memory `self._jobs` with Firestore client operations (async `google-cloud-firestore`).
        - Implement CRUD operations for jobs in Firestore.
    - **Sub-task 4.1.4: Database Migrations (Not typically required for Firestore schema changes like SQL).**
        - Data migration/transformation scripts might be needed if structure changes significantly later.
    - **Sub-task 4.1.5: Test Job Persistence thoroughly with Firestore.**
        - Ensure jobs are saved, retrieved, updated, and listed correctly.
        - Test application restarts.

- **Task 4.2: Implement Detailed Real-time Progress Tracking for Jobs (Firestore Based)**
    - (Sub-tasks remain largely the same, but `Job.progress` updates will write to Firestore)
    - **Sub-task 4.2.1: Design Progress Update Mechanism.**
    - **Sub-task 4.2.2: Update `EnhancedMultiStepContentGenerationService` Progress Reporting.**
    - **Sub-task 4.2.3: Update `JobManager._process_job` to use Detailed Progress (writing to Firestore).**

- **Task 4.3: Advanced Error Handling & Retry Mechanisms (Leveraging Cloud Tasks/Workflows)**
    - (Sub-tasks remain relevant, potentially enhanced by GCP capabilities)
    - **Sub-task 4.3.1: Define Granular Error Codes.** (Partially complete, refine for GCP services)
    - **Sub-task 4.3.2: Implement Retries for Transient Errors.**
        - Leverage Cloud Tasks queue retry policies.
        - Consider Cloud Workflows for more complex retry/error handling logic across multiple steps.
    - **Sub-task 4.3.3: Ensure Idempotency for Retried Operations.**

- **Task 4.4: Implement Multi-Step Orchestration with Cloud Workflows**
    - **Sub-task 4.4.1: Design Content Generation Workflow in Cloud Workflows YAML.**
        - Break down `EnhancedMultiStepContentGenerationService` into callable steps/microservices if necessary, or orchestrate calls to different parts of the API (which could be Cloud Run services invoked by Workflow).
        - Define states, transitions, error handling, and retries within the workflow definition.
    - **Sub-task 4.4.2: Integrate `JobManager` with Cloud Workflows.**
        - `JobManager` (or a Cloud Task handler triggered after initial job creation) triggers a Cloud Workflow execution.
        - Workflow updates job status in Firestore at key stages (e.g., by calling a small Cloud Run endpoint or using Firestore connector if available/suitable).
    - **Sub-task 4.4.3: Implement Callbacks or Polling for Workflow Completion.**
        - Cloud Workflows can call back to an HTTP endpoint on completion/failure, or `JobManager` can poll workflow status (less ideal for serverless).

### Execution Path 5: Scalability & Performance (GCP Focused)
**Goal**: Ensure the application can handle increasing load and perform efficiently using GCP's scalable services.

- **Task 5.1: Implement Robust Background Worker System with Cloud Tasks**
    - **Sub-task 5.1.1: Worker Technology Chosen: Cloud Tasks.** (Decision made as part of GCP architecture)
    - **Sub-task 5.1.2: Integrate Cloud Tasks for Job Processing.**
        - `JobManager`'s `create_job` method creates a job document in Firestore and then enqueues a task in Cloud Tasks.
        - The Cloud Task payload will contain the job ID.
        - Create an HTTP endpoint (e.g., on Cloud Run, potentially a separate service or specific endpoint) that Cloud Tasks will call to process the job. This endpoint will fetch job details from Firestore and execute the content generation logic (e.g., by calling `EnhancedMultiStepContentGenerationService`).
    - **Sub-task 5.1.3: Configure Cloud Tasks Queue.**
        - Set dispatch rates, max concurrent dispatches, retry policies via Terraform.
    - **Sub-task 5.1.4: Secure Cloud Tasks Invocation.**
        - Ensure only Cloud Tasks can invoke the worker HTTP endpoint (e.g., using OIDC authentication with the invoker service account for Cloud Tasks).

- **Task 5.2: Add Missing Job Parameters to `ContentRequest` (and through the system) - VERIFIED COMPLETE**
    - This task was completed in the "Enable End-to-End Testing" sprint.

- **Task 5.3: API Rate Limiting & Throttling using API Gateway**
    - **Sub-task 5.3.1: Configure Rate Limiting in API Gateway.**
        - Define rate limits (requests per minute/key) in the API Gateway configuration (OpenAPI spec or service definition).
        - Apply to job creation and potentially status polling endpoints.
        - Requires API Key management strategy (API Gateway can manage API keys).
    - **Sub-task 5.3.2: Test Rate Limiting.**

### Execution Path 6: Advanced Security (GCP Focused)
**Goal**: Harden the application using GCP security best practices and services.
- **Task 6.1: Secure Service-to-Service Communication.**
    - Use IAM and service accounts with least privilege for all GCP service interactions (Cloud Run to Firestore, Cloud Tasks to Cloud Run, etc.).
    - Leverage VPC Service Controls if appropriate for project complexity.
- **Task 6.2: API Security with API Gateway.**
    - Implement API key validation via API Gateway.
    - Consider JWT validation or other authentication mechanisms if needed.
    - Ensure HTTPS is enforced.
- **Task 6.3: Secret Management with Google Secret Manager.**
    - Ensure ALL secrets (API keys, database credentials, etc.) are stored in Secret Manager and accessed by Cloud Run via its service account.
- **Task 6.4: Vulnerability Scanning.**
    - Enable Artifact Registry vulnerability scanning for container images.
    - Consider Web Security Scanner for deployed Cloud Run services.
- **Task 6.5: Review IAM Permissions Regularly.**
    - Periodically audit service account permissions.

### Execution Path 7: Maintainability & Advanced Code Quality
**Goal**: Ensure the codebase is easy to understand, modify, and extend.
- **Task 7.1: Comprehensive Unit and Integration Tests.**
    - Increase test coverage, especially for interactions with GCP services (using emulators or mocks).
    - Test Cloud Workflow logic.
- **Task 7.2: Consistent Code Style and Linting.** (Already in place, maintain)
- **Task 7.3: Documentation Updates.**
    - Update `README.md` with new GCP setup, deployment, and local development instructions.
    - Document Terraform IaC.
    - Document Cloud Workflow definitions.
    - Update service architecture diagrams.
- **Task 7.4: CI/CD Pipeline Enhancements.**
    - Automate Terraform apply in CI/CD (e.g., GitHub Actions).
    - Automate container builds and pushes to Artifact Registry.
    - Automate Cloud Run deployments.
    - Include automated testing in the pipeline.

### Execution Path 8: Advanced Observability (GCP Focused)
**Goal**: Gain deep insights into application performance, errors, and usage patterns using GCP observability tools.
- **Task 8.1: Structured Logging.**
    - Implement structured logging (JSON) in the FastAPI application for better parsing in Cloud Logging.
    - Include trace IDs for request tracing across services.
- **Task 8.2: Custom Metrics & Dashboards in Cloud Monitoring.**
    - Define custom metrics for key application performance indicators (e.g., job processing time, error rates by type, queue lengths).
    - Create Cloud Monitoring dashboards to visualize these metrics.
- **Task 8.3: Alerting in Cloud Monitoring.**
    - Set up alerts for critical errors, high latency, resource exhaustion, and other important conditions.
- **Task 8.4: Distributed Tracing with Cloud Trace.**
    - Instrument the application to send traces to Cloud Trace, especially for requests involving multiple GCP services (API Gateway -> Cloud Run -> Cloud Tasks -> Cloud Run -> Firestore).

### Execution Path 9: Frontend Development
**Goal**: Develop a user interface for interacting with the content generation service.
- (Tasks remain as previously defined or to be detailed later, assuming this is primarily backend-focused for now)
- **Task 9.1: Basic UI for Job Submission and Status Tracking.**
- **Task 9.2: UI for Viewing Generated Content.**

### Execution Path 10: Cost-Effectiveness & Optimization (GCP Focused)
**Goal**: Ensure the application runs cost-effectively on GCP.
- **Task 10.1: Right-Sizing GCP Resources.**
    - Monitor Cloud Run instance performance and adjust CPU/memory settings.
    - Optimize Firestore usage (e.g., efficient queries, minimize document size).
- **Task 10.2: GCP Budgets and Cost Alerts.**
    - Set up GCP budgets and alerts to monitor spending.
- **Task 10.3: Review Service Tiers and Pricing Models.**
    - Choose appropriate service tiers (e.g., for Vertex AI models, API Gateway).
- **Task 10.4: Optimize Cloud Workflow Executions.**
    - Minimize unnecessary steps or expensive operations within workflows.
