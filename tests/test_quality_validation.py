        # Introduction to Algebra

        ## Learning Objectives
        By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
        - Understand what algebra is and why it's useful
        - Solve simple algebraic equations
        - Apply algebraic thinking to real-world problems

        ## What is Algebra?
        Algebra is a branch of mathematics that uses symbols and letters to represent numbers.
        According to research in mathematics education, students learn best through concrete examples.

        For example, instead of saying "some number plus 3 equals 7", we can write x + 3 = 7.

        ## Examples and Practice
        Let's try some examples together:
        1. If x + 5 = 12, what is x?
        2. In real life, you might use algebra to calculate how much money you need to save.

        ## Exercise
        Try solving these problems on your own:
        - 2x = 10
        - y - 3 = 8

        ## Summary
        Algebra helps us solve problems by using symbols to represent unknown values.
        With practice, you'll find it becomes a powerful tool for understanding mathematics.
