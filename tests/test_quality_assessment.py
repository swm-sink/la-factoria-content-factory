            # Introduction to Algebra

            ## Learning Objectives
            By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
            - Understand what algebra is and why it's useful
            - Solve simple algebraic equations
            - Apply algebraic thinking to real-world problems

            ## What is Algebra?
            Algebra is a branch of mathematics that uses symbols and letters to represent numbers.
            For example, instead of saying "some number plus 3 equals 7", we can write x + 3 = 7.

            ## Examples and Practice
            Let's try some examples together:
            1. If x + 5 = 12, what is x?
            2. In real life, you might use algebra to calculate how much money you need to save.

            ## Exercise
            Try solving these problems on your own:
            - 2x = 10
            - y - 3 = 8

            ## Summary
            Algebra helps us solve problems by using symbols to represent unknown values.
            With practice, you'll find it becomes a powerful tool for understanding mathematics.
